419551477591_2819627	One favorite part is when the Minions and the girls are trashing the place with toilet paper and Gru comes in to stop them.  The girls blame the minions or "gru's cousins" by saying - It wasn't us, it was your cousins!  The minion turns to gru and says - WHAA???My other favorite part is when Agnos sees the fluffy unicorn and she says - It's so fluffy, I'm gonna die!  Then when she wins it she screams - IT'S SOO FLUFFY!!

One day she decided to kill herself. Because even her parents ignored her. She jumed out her window. No one noticed utill people started dissapearing. Kathy haunted them. She made them suffer like the way she did. She hung them slowly and stabed them over and over very slowly so they could suffer like she did.If you don't send this message to 15 diffrent comments you will die tonight by Kathy. Because she considers it ignooring her.Example 1:Dave looked at the first sentece and said, "Spam" And the next day the neighbors found him in his backyard, dead.Example 2:Joane was alone. She didn't have kids or a husband. She had alot of friends. When She had a sleepover with them she quickly had to check her e-mail.She saw this message and sent it to only 6 people because she thought she couldn't die that night beacuse she was surounded by people. The next morning Joane's friends found her in her bathtub, dead.If you don't send this, Kathy WILL find you

419551477591_3442462	This is not a joke! Carry on reading! Or you will die, even if you only looked at the word warning!Once there was a little girl called Clarissa, she was ten-yea...rs-old and she lived in a mental hospital, because she killed her mom........................... an..................d her dad. She got so bad she went to kill all the staff in the hospital so the government decided that best idea was to get rid of her so they set up a special room to kill her, as humane as possible but it went wrong the machine they were using went wrong. And she sat there in agony for hours until she finally died. Now every week on the day of her death she returns to the person that reads this letter, on a monday night at 12:00a.m. She creeps into your room and kills you slowly, by cutting you and watching you bleed to death.Now send this to ten other pics on this one site, and she will haunt someone else who doesn't pass this on like you did. And forget about you. Example 1:Jenny didn't believe this and deleted it without even reading the whole thing! A few days later on the monday night, she was woken up by loud footsteps and heavy breathing, there was ClarissSee moreSeptember 10 at 5:00pm ·See More

114439718608568_388720	WARNING!This is not a joke! Carry on reading! Or you will die, even if you only looked at the word warning!Once there was a little girl called Clarissa, she was ten-years-old and she lived in a mental hospital, because she killed her mom an.........d her dad. She got so bad she went to kill all the staff in the hospital so the government decided that the... See More... See More... See More... See More... See More... See More... See More... See More best idea was to get rid of her so they set up a special room to kill her, as humane as possible but it went wrong the machine they were using went wrong. And she sat there in agony for hours until she finally died. Now every week on the day of her death she returns to the person that reads this letter, on a monday night at 12:00a.m. She creeps into your room and kills you slowly, by cutting you and watching you bleed to death.Now send this to ten other pics on this one site, and she will haunt someone else who doesn't pass this on like you did. And forget about you. Example 1:Jenny didn't believe this and deleted it without even reading the whole thing! A few days later on the monday night, she was woken up by loud footsteps and heavy breathing, there was Clarissa standing there with a huge knife and well Jenny is history nowSee More
114439718608568_388815	ITS SO FLUFFY IM GoNNA DIE!!!!

114439718608568_390414	OK guys, this truly is freaky, the phone literally rang as soon as I read the last word of this email!!!!!I am taking the bait - what do I have to lose right? Hope it works! Supposedly The Phone Will Ring Right After You Do This. Just read ...the little stories and think of a wish as you scroll all the way to the bottom. There is a message there... See More... ... See MoreSee More - ... See Morethen make your wish. No attachment on this one.I'm 13 years old, and I wished that my dad would come home from the army, because he'd been having problems with his heart and right leg. It was 2:53 p.m. When I made my wish. At 3:07 p.m.(14 minutes later), the doorbell rang, and there my Dad was, luggage and all!!I'm Katie and I'm 20 and I've been having trouble in my job and on the verge of quitting. I made a simple wish that my boss would get a new job. That was at 1:35and at 2:55 there was an announcement that he was promoted and was leaving for another city. Believe me...this really works!!!... See more... See moreMy name is Ann and I am 45 years of age. I had always been single and had been hoping to get into a nice, loving relationship for many years. While kind of daydreaming (and right after receiving this email) I wished that a quality person would finally come into my life. That was at 9:10 AM on a Tuesday. At 9:55 AM a FedEx delivery man came into my office. He was cute, polite and could not stop smiling at me. He started coming back almost everyday (even without packages) and asked me out a week later. We married 6 months later and now have been happily married for 2 years. What a great email it was!!... See More... See More... See More... See More... See More... See More... See more... See More... See More... See More... See More... ... See More... See More... See More... See More... See More...(tharr be more) Peer into the depths... See MoreSee MoreJust scroll down to the end, but while you do, think of a wish. Make your wish when you have completed scrolling. Whatever age you are, is the number of minutes it will take for your wish to come true. ex. you are 25 years old, it will take 25 minutes for your wish to come true). However, if you don't send this to people in 5 minutes, you will have bad luck for years!!Go for it!!!SCROLL DOWN!******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************STOP!!!Congratulations!!! Your wish will now come true in your age minutes.Now follow this carefully....it can be very rewarding!!!!If you send this to 10 more people, other than the 5 that you already have to send to, something major that you've been wanting will happen

144774822206152_1156307	I don't think eating things that look like Twinkies in Overalls is supposed to taste good.

144774822206152_1156321	i need to take my little niece there! she's been wanting to try the cinniMinions. :o)
144774822206152_1156323	I wasn't impressed with the food IHOP has. The only thing good about the Minionberry pancakes was the fact they were lemon - it would have been nice if it had real berries instead of sundae topping. The ciniminions were dryand the minionaide was just lemonaide with some colored sugar crystals on top...didn't try the taters. The movie however was great!!!
144774822206152_1156326	OMG....their good I had the Minion Berry Pancakes and Minionade.

144774822206152_1156372	Those are my...cousins.
144774822206152_1156373	Minion Berry Pancakes are great! and I don't care for pancakes, the lemon flavor is light, but still enough to taste and the berries are very good.
144774822206152_1156379	They need to learn to steal better stuff :/
144774822206152_1156395	The loaded minion taters are soooo good!

We were planning on going to a great local place with Luxe level theaters and stadium seating only to find that we had to go to an older theater a little farther away.  It was still great, but a slight dissapointment.  
112199138831567_313328	how is it free if you have to buy a dvd to get the discount?
112199138831567_313348	These Blu-Rays are also available at Best Buy.  Instant gratification!!

141925515833483_1103561	The best cartoon ever made!! Love iiiit!!!
141925515833483_1103592	This movie is very funny - for adults, but for children, the portrayal of adoption is very poor.  I'm not sure why old stereotypes of adoption are still pushed in main-stream movies.  The movie shows 3 girls being adopted by a man, portraying someone he's not, no background check.  Later, the girls are an inconvienece and returned like merchandise, only later does he get the real idea of family - which is good, but could (and should) have been shown in a much more positive way.  Luckily, only my husband and I went.  I only heard adults laughing, most of the jokes are over the heads of children, definite no for adopted children or families.
141925515833483_1103620	IT'S SO FLUFFYYYYY!!!!

138296222866138_1028230	Mine didn't work-Hero.If it worked fine can someone tell us what the Minions said???!!!!
138296222866138_1028232	I have an ITouch, so it didn't work for me : (
138296222866138_1028234	Loved it! It didn't work for us on opening day 1st movie, but had to take friends a different day and it worked fine. So Cute! Can't wait for the DVD I hope for a Minion only movie!!! :)
138296222866138_1028236	I guess people don't understand that it has to be used during the 3D movie
138296222866138_1028245	If you've got a go-phone, don't even try!
138296222866138_1028251	This was my 3 year old's first movie theater experience and we both loved it. 
138296222866138_1028253	go despicable me it was funny intense action filled funny and touching did i mention funny
138296222866138_1028254	we saw it today and the IPhone app didn't work - great movie regardless
138296222866138_1028259	I saw it the same day it came out
138296222866138_1028261	Went to see Despicable Me in 3D today.  It was great fun!

138296222866138_1028288	I want to see it.. I want to see it..... "oooo its soooo fluffy"!!
138296222866138_1028291	yet another reason I hate stuff that requires you to pay extra just to see things. POINTLESS - Unfollowing your page because half ppl got scammed. SO glad I don't have an expensive phone that requires APPS to do stupid shit.
138296222866138_1028294	Don't no what two say all
138296222866138_1028303	loved the movie, the app didn't work though...
138296222866138_1028329	It's a waste don't use it unless you want your battery dead!

138296222866138_1028359	does it relly work or is it a waste???
138296222866138_1028380	I have an iPhone and it worked fine for me.  I love the shadow puppets. "my name is Gru. I have male pattern baldness.  I also have male pattern fatness.".  Hahaha. Quality

138296222866138_1028566	that was the best part of the movie for me!
138296222866138_1028574	I loved the Sleepy Kittens book and bought it today at Barnes & Nobles!

138296222866138_1029039	Loved the movie. The kids and I saw it tonight and I laughed so hard I was crying. It helped that the older people next to us were laughing just as hard.
138296222866138_1029048	the app didn't work! 
138296222866138_1029056	I saw it in regular, app worked on my Droid, hubby's app killer killed it on his so he didn't get to see what they were saying cause the kids crowded my phone.  Was super cute, gonna see it again!  Hope the app works when it's out on BluRay!
138296222866138_1029061	It doesn't work on my phone :-(

138296222866138_1029117	You do know that before the movie even starts they tell you to turn off your phone so you do not bother the other people in the movies.
138296222866138_1029165	Loved it the whole movie was cute!!
138296222866138_1029223	does not work on ipod touches!
138296222866138_1029299	ITS SO FLUFFY
138296222866138_1029317	LOVED the movie but woulda been just as good in reg instead of poppin the extra $$$ for 3D just to see what the minions said at the end ... course if the APP had worked on my BBerry may have been different story..... i say save your money see it reg wait till they get the app working well 
138296222866138_1029435	This app only works on the new Sprint HTC evo. That's what they said on the commercial for this app. 
138296222866138_1029444	wish they could make it work on more phones :(
138296222866138_1029510	OMG OMG OMG... I can't believe I can actually see the creepers who visit my profile now! LOL The FB Profile viewer actually exists! WOW! http://ow.ly/29RxW

138296222866138_1029561	I will possibly be seeing it for the third time tomorrow, but I don't have a phone with which I can download this app, and I'm okay with that.
138296222866138_1029580	I wish I had an iphone or something similar so I could do this. I saw it once but I'm gonna see it again!
138296222866138_1029582	I wish I had an iphone or something similar so I could do this. I saw it once but I'm gonna see it again!

138296222866138_1029807	This App "Best Buy Movie Mode" works on Android, iphone, Blackberry, and Windows Mobile OS. Plus while it was translating at the end credits, I got a "For Close" like 8 times. Android Developer FAIL!! 
138296222866138_1029819	@Vanessa Gonzales, The ipod Touch needs to have an Internet connection for it work (WIFI). Because the app uses the internet to collect data during the movie, thats how it knows when to translate.
138296222866138_1029825	@Auberon Valentine, you don't need to have an iphone for this app to work. This app would work on  any Android, Blackberry, or Windows Mobile device.
138296222866138_1029831	@Brian Rodgers, Did you see it in 3D or 2D?
138296222866138_1029849	@Azalea Whedbee,@Angelica Garrido,@Angela Henz: What mobile device were you using? 
138296222866138_1029870	(Head Admin of the T-mobile My Touch 3G with Google FB Fan Page)http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1634585303#!/T.Mobile.MyTouch.3G.withGoogle?ref=tsHTC Android Users Welcome!
138296222866138_1029877	@Kevin: Did you start the app at the beginning of the Movie?, because I used my android phone (with a Full battery) and it only drained half of it. And what Blackberry did you use the app on?
138296222866138_1030622	Dont buy it
138296222866138_1030835	It didn't work on my winows mobile phone : ( I bet it would have worked on Android!
138296222866138_1030927	We downloaded it and it didn't work!!!!
138296222866138_1031035	We saw it for the second time yesterday -- our son was home from school and wanted to see it.  There's so much you miss the first time you need to see it again.  GO!!
138296222866138_1031454	I want a minion and a minionator
138296222866138_1031540	wow I can't wait for it to come out on DVD guys

138296222866138_1032829	App worked fine on my iphone. Just make sure you get to the movie early because the app is signaled by a tone system at the start of it. Loved when a minion was like that he could hear twilight in the next theatre over. lol

141487362533976_1074179	Too much sugar...but at least it is natural sugar & no fake crap!
141487362533976_1074192	The CinniMinions are the best thing IHOP has ever put on their menu.  They are just delightful.
141487362533976_1074194	Bryon likes this I hope I watch this movie
141487362533976_1074199	We don't have Ihop's near us any more, they all left a couple years ago. 
141487362533976_1074212	the minionade was really yummy!
141487362533976_1074213	I worked at IHOP & My service was Spot on. Never had a compliant. Only got complaints from Jealous  Co-workers. :P
141487362533976_1074218	The minionade is actually candied strawberry syrup, lemonade, and sprinkles on top=yummy.  :)

141487362533976_1074253	There are Ihops in ALL states :)

141487362533976_1074293	our ihop wouldn't show us the minion menu because they were out of minons :/
141487362533976_1074301	I love the Cinniminions. However, the minionade is too sweet with them.   
141487362533976_1074305	Why are they all "minion". There could be something like... Gruberry pancakes!
141487362533976_1074354	I had both the Cinniminions and Minionade the other day......sooooooo good!!!!!!!!!!!!!
141487362533976_1074473	Was there yesterday and that is where I fell in love with the minions.  I want some of my very own.  I thought cinniMionions was cute, and minionade. <3
141487362533976_1074502	@ Katie. The three in/near my town left not soon after they took over former Denny's buildings. Smaller family owned restaurants with quality food prevailed. Technically there are two in the nearest city. Neither of which are in areas I would wish to visit. Just because there are Ihops in every state does not mean that they are near everyone.
141487362533976_1074521	Those cinniminions sound soxhood I just want to eat them but not a lot of tjem
141487362533976_1074533	It all sounds so good.

141487362533976_1074841	Hello. My name is Stacey. I am 15 years old and I am beat up by my parents every night. I have bloodshot eyes and moldy hair. I killed my mother. My lips are cut and my nose is broken. This is my story. Every day my parents abuse me by cutting me or just beating me up. Once my mother got mad at me and she taped my mouth shut and locked me in a... See More... ... See MoreSee More... ... See MoreSee More... ... See Moretiny room with no food and water for 2 days. When she let me out, I strangled her and killed her....The cops came and took me to a mental hospital. I murdered my doctor and some of the other patients and I broke out. While I was running I was shot by a cop and died. BUT I wasn't done. I came back for one reason, to kill my father that also abused me. If you don't post this to at least 5 other groups, I will murder you one day this week. Why do I care about this text? Well it warns the non believers and my father. You wonder how I am typing this? I am ghost I can control energy, I am capable of typing on a computer by making myself solid. You think I can't find you? I track these done and I will teleport into your room and stand there for 2 hours then stand over your face. You will look right into my soulless eyes and I will murder you
141487362533976_1075468	i like this!!
141487362533976_1075472	Oh man, I saw the dang commercial and those Minion foods look DELICIOUS.

See More ... Näytä lisäähaunted them.She made them suffer like the way she did.She hung them slowly and stabed them over and over very slowly so they could suffer like she did.If you don't send this message to 15 different comments you will die tonight by Kathy.Because she considers it ignoring her.Example 1:Dave looked at the first sentece and said,"Spam" And the next day the neighbors found him in his backyard,dead.Example 2:Joane was alone.She didn't have kids or a husband.She had alot of friends.When she had a sleepover with them she quickly had to check her e-mail.She saw this message and sent it to only 6 people because she thought she couldn't die that night beacuse she was surounded by people

411696222591_5577072	WARNING! This is not a joke! Carry on reading!Or you will die, even if you only looked at the word warning! Once there was a little girl called Clarissa, she was ten-years-old and she lived in a mental hospital, because she killed her mom an..................................................................................................d her dad.She got so mad she went to kill all the staff in the hospital so the government decided that the best idea was to get rid of her so they set up a special room to kill her,as humane as possible but it went wrong the machine they were using went wrong. And she sat there in agony for hours until she finally died. Now every week on the day of her death she returns to the person that reads this letter, on a Monday night at 12:00a.m. She creeps into your room and kills you slowly, by cutting you and watching you bleed to death. Now send this to ten other pics on this one site, and she will haunt someone else who doesn't pass this on like you did. And forget about you.

141524869197121_1071440	Patricia, they lied to you. It's not F6, it's Alt+F4 on a pc or command-Q on a mac.
141524869197121_1071443	because, josiah, they r homos, and that is what homos do

My crush is the father of my child and he won't be anywhere near me friday. at least you didn't put up a stupid "you will die in 5 days" thing...if these were true i'd have died 1,324,563,247 times already..

141524869197121_1071464	Why can't we mark them as spam any longer? We used to be able to flag them...
141524869197121_1071466	Bummer! Our area theaters are NOT showing the 3D version
141524869197121_1071467	Patricia will you please grow up...

141524869197121_1071579	Tonight!
141524869197121_1071617	You have to be on the "Despicable Me" page (or any other page). I just flagged 10 of these kids for spam. Guess what? There is a way to not see these "children" who spam all the walls! Click on "Flag" then "Advertisement/Spam" on the drop down menu. Click "Undo" (which only Undoes your hiding not the report), then click on the person's name. Go to their profile and go down the left column to "Block/Report". If it looks like a fake profile, click both boxes. You'll get two drop down menus. On the first one, click "Fake Profile". On the second one, click "Does not represent a real person." If you don't want to report it as fake, you can click the first box only and "Unwanted contact" on first drop down menu. It cleans up the thread really fast! ;)
141524869197121_1071657	Yeah, why can't we flag people anymore?...FB is probably sick of it and doesn't want to hear about it...
141524869197121_1071719	I CANT WAIT I THINK IM GONNA LOVE THIS MOVIE :]

Because even her parents ignored her. She jumed out her window. No one noticed utill people started dissapearing. Kathy haunted them. She made them suffer like the way she did. She hung them slowly and stabed them over and over very slowly so they could suffer like she did.If you don't send this message to 15 diffrent comments you will die tonight by Kathy. Because she considers it ignooring her.Example 1:Dave looked at the first sentece and said, "Spam" And the next day the neighbors found him in his backyard, dead.Example 2:Joane was alone. She didn't have kids or a husband. She had alot of friends. When She had a sleepover with them she quickly had to check her e-mail.She saw this message and sent it to only 6 people because she thought she couldn't die that night beacuse she was surounded by people.

849804892055_14638224	WARNING! CARRY ON READING OR ELSE YOU WILL DIE, even if you only looked at the word warning! Once there was a little girl named Clarissa. She was ten-years-old and she lived in a mental hospital because she killed her mom and dad. She got so bad that she went to kill all the staff in the hospital, so the More-government decided that the best idea was to get rid of her so they set up a special room to kill her as humane as possible, but it went wrong the machine they were using went wrong. And she sat there in agony for hours until she died. Now every week on the day of her death, she returns to the person that reads this letter, on a Monday night at 12:00a.m. She creeps into your room and kills you slowly, by cutting you and watching you bleed to death. Now send this to ten other pictures on this one site, and she will haunt someone else who doesn't. This isn't fake. Apparently, if you copy and paste this to ten comments in the next ten minutes, u will have the best day of ur life tomorrow. U will either get kissed or asked out.

She hung them slowly and stabed them over and over very slowly so they could suffer like she did.If you don't send this message to 15 diffrent comments you will die tonight by Kathy. Because she considers it ignooring her.Example 1:Dave looked at the first sentece and said, "Spam" And the next day the neighbors found him in his backyard, dead.Example 2:Joane was alone. She didn't have kids or a husband. She had alot of friends. When She had a sleepover with them she quickly had to check her e-mail.She saw this message and sent it to only 6 people because she thought she couldn't die that night beacuse she was surounded by people.

135643283131762_954057	This is not a joke! Carry on reading! Or you will die, even if you only looked at the word warning!Once there was a little girl called Clarissa, she was ten-years-old and she lived in a mental hospital, because she killed her mom and her dad. She got so bad she went to kill all the staff in the hospital so the government... See More ... ... See... See More... See more ... See MoreMoreSee Moredecided that... ... See MoreSee More ... See Morethe... See More... See More... See More... See More... See More... See More... See More... See More... See More... See More best idea was to get rid of her so they set up a special room to kill her, as humane as possible but it went wrong the machine they were using went wrong. And she sat there in agony for hours until she finally died. Now every week on the day of her death she returns to the person that reads this letter, on a monday night at 12:00a.m. She creeps into your room and kills you slowly, by cutting you and watching you bleed to death.Now send this to ten other pics on this one site, and she will haunt someone else who doesn't pass this on like you did. And forget about you. Example 1:Jenny didn't believe this and deleted it without even reading the whole thing! A few days later on the monday night, she was woken up by loud footsteps and heavy breathing, there was Clarissa standing there with a huge knife and well Jenny is history now

140938119256387_1071431	That's what I want to know.
140938119256387_1071435	people think they can comment first and its a race to see who commented first, second, etc.
140938119256387_1071437	Nobody gives a flying F*ck if your first, second or third
140938119256387_1071455	I love how only one of these comments actually has ANYTHING to do with the link. GOOD JOB!By the way, I like this. :)

140938119256387_1071502	If kids are reading this, they're doing so against the ToS (have to be 13 to get an account) and the parents of said kids should be ashamed of themselves.

Her mother couldnt take all the crying, so she decied it was time for her to go. She buried her baby alive in her back yard. After she buried her she could still hear Marry crying. So she dug her back up and stabbed her one time in the arm, and buried her again. Marry cried harder, but a few hours later it stopped. At exactly 12:42, Marry died. She bleeded to death. Now her sprit hauntes the world. When your sleeping, she stabbes you in the arm and watches you bleed to death. And that's how she got the name "Bloody Marry" this is the true story of her. She wants everyone to feel her pain that she felt. Apperantly, if you repost thThis isn't fake.

In the next 53 minuets someone will say I love you or I'm sorryis to 12 other comments you will have the best day of your life tomorrow. But if you break this chain you die at exactly 12:42 tonight by Bloody Marry. Don't belive me? You'll see! (This is really creepMay 25 at 5:03pm · Like

136219309730742_1073196	A year ago A girl named Kathy was hated by everyone. Everyone made fun of her. She was ignored. Even by messages. One day she decided to kill herself. Because even her parents ignored her. She jumed out her window. No one noticed utill people started dissapearing. Kathy haunted them. She made them suffer like the way she did. She hung them slowly ... See Moreand stabed them over and over very slowly so they could suffer like she did. If you don't send this message to 15 diffrent comments you will die tonight by Kathy. Because she considers it ignooring her. Example 1: Dave looked at the first sentece and said, "Spam" And the next day the neighbors found him in his backyard, dead. Example 2: Joane was alone. She didn't have kids or a husband. She had alot of friends. When She had a sleepover with them she quickly had to check her e-mail.She saw this message and sent it to only 6 people because she thought she couldn't die that night beacuse she was surounded by people. The next morning Joane's friends found her in her bathtub, dead. If you don't send this, Kathy WILL find you

125904197450767_731010	his is not a joke! Carry on reading! Or you will die, even if you only looked at the word warning!Once there was a little girl called Clarissa, she was ten-years-old and she lived in a mental hospital, because she killed her mom and her dad. She got so bad she went to kill all the staff in the hospital so the government decided that... ... See... See More... See more... See More ... See MoreMoreSee More... ... See MoreSee More... ...

See MoreSee More ... See Morethe... See More... See More... See More... See More... See More... See More... See More... See More... See More... See More best idea was to get rid of her so they set up a special room to kill her, as humane as possible but it went wrong the machine they were using went wrong. And she sat there in agony for hours until she finally died. Now every week on the day of her death she returns to the person that reads this letter, on a monday night at 12:00a.m. She creeps into your room and kills you slowly, by cutting you and watching you bleed to death.Now send this to ten other pics on this one site, and she will haunt someone else who doesn't pass this on like you did. And forget about you. Example 1:Jenny didn't believe this and deleted it without even reading the whole thing! A few days later on the monday night, she was woken up by loud footsteps and heavy breathing, there was Clarissa standing there with a huge knife and well Jenny is history now
125904197450767_731018	LOL Glad I missed the chain letter!  She was removed before I saw it!  I so want to see this movie!  Saw the preview at Toy Story III, and on TV, but hadn't really heard of it before Toy Story III!  The kids remind me of my kids when they were little!
125904197450767_731054	Oh, but another loser snuck one in before my comment though!
125904197450767_731386	I can't wait to see this movie !  
125904197450767_731403	If anyone else loved the vampire musical in forgetting Sarah Marshall lets see if we can get enough hype to get it made! Jason Segel had an awesome idea and it is so awesome we got see some of it in the movie! Lets see if we can get the real thing to happen!!!! Who doesn't love Dracula?http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=104758996238078&ref=mf
125904197450767_733838	seen the preview when I went to the movie lastnight with my husband, I want a minion they are so darn cute.
125904197450767_737878	Saw the trailer when Toy Story 3 came out. Toy Story 3 was awesome and this movie looks funny and cute!
125904197450767_751161	haha I love it how every time the kid asks him a question he cracks up- I could hardly watch this because I was too busy laughing at him laughing at that little girl's question :P
125904197450767_767197	I think it would be awesome if Jason Segel developed that Dracula play when only see a bit of in 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall'.

See MoreSee More ... See Morethe... See More... See More... See More... See More... See More... See More... See More... See More... See More... See More best idea was to get rid of her so they set up a special room to kill her, as humane as possible but it went wrong the machine they were using went wrong. And she sat there in agony for hours until she finally died. Now every week on the day of her death she returns to the person that reads this letter, on a monday night at 12:00a.m. She creeps into your room and kills you slowly, by cutting you and watching you bleed to death.Now send this to ten other pics on this one site, and she will haunt someone else who doesn't pass this on like you did. And forget about you. Example 1:Jenny didn't believe this and deleted it without even reading the whole thing! A few days later on the monday night, she was woken up by loud footsteps and heavy breathing, there was Clarissa standing there with a huge knife and well Jenny is history now

407215145162_25384238	Keep reading on, or die tonight a exactly 12:42. This is based on a TRUE STORY! Once there was a baby girl named Marry. Her mother couldnt take all the crying, so she decied it was time for her to go. She buried her baby alive in her back yard. After she buried her she could still hear Marry crying. So she dug her back up and stabbed her one time in the arm, and buried her again. Marry cried harder, but a few hours later it stopped. At exactly 12:42, Marry died. She bleeded to death. Now her sprit hauntes the world. When your sleeping, she stabbes you in the arm and watches you bleed to death. And that's how she got the name "Bloody Marry" this is the true story of her. She wants everyone to feel her pain that she felt. Apperantly, if you repost thThis isn't fake.

407215145162_25593881	WARNING! CARRY ON READING OR ELSE YOU WILL DIE, even if you only looked at the word warning! Once there was a little girl named Clarissa. She was ten-years-old and she lived in a mental hospital because she killed her mom and dad. She got so bad that she went to kill all the staff in the hospital, so the More-government decided that the best idea was to get rid of her so they set up a special room to kill her as humane as possible, but it went wrong the machine they were using went wrong. And she sat there in agony for hours until she died. Now every week on the day of her death, she returns to the person that reads this letter, on a Monday night at 12:00a.m. She creeps into your room and kills you slowly, by cutting you and watching you bleed to death. Now send this to ten other pictures on this one site, and she will haunt someone else who doesn't. This isn't fake. Apparently, if you copy and paste this to ten comments in the next ten minutes, u will have the best day of ur life tomorrow. U will either get kissed or asked out.

406762075162_25593928	WARNING! CARRY ON READING OR ELSE YOU WILL DIE, even if you only looked at the word warning! Once there was a little girl named Clarissa. She was ten-years-old and she lived in a mental hospital because she killed her mom and dad. She got so bad that she went to kill all the staff in the hospital, so the More-government decided that the best idea was to get rid of her so they set up a special room to kill her as humane as possible, but it went wrong the machine they were using went wrong. And she sat there in agony for hours until she died. Now every week on the day of her death, she returns to the person that reads this letter, on a Monday night at 12:00a.m. She creeps into your room and kills you slowly, by cutting you and watching you bleed to death. Now send this to ten other pictures on this one site, and she will haunt someone else who doesn't. This isn't fake.

112729932106834_331754	OMG I've been dying to get these as ringtones. Especially "He's so fluffy I'm gunna die!"
112729932106834_331781	The iphone one is not working. They all downloaded as its so fluffy.. And not even the fluffy word comes out all the way and all the other ringtones are the fluff one too :(
112729932106834_331791	Only the Giiggle works on the iPhone.
112729932106834_331795	You should get a text that asks you to send an "OK" text back. Then you should get a text with the file attached. 
112729932106834_331856	can't wait to see this movie.
112729932106834_331911	I want my ringtone :(

112729932106834_332527	Hey Rachael - You have to go to your settings and allow both downloads and ads. I did a reset recently, and forgot to change them to yes. If they say no, you won't get them. I went thru this about 3 weeks ago for the giggle!

132035606823341_807898	Who the hell does he think he is to have the right to take over the world? That is a right that I and I alone have claimed. When I conquer the world and enslave mankind, just as soon as I've wiped Starbucks off the planet, removed Nancy Grace from TV and placed Martha Stewart in an old folks home, he and I are going to have a little chat about world domination.
132035606823341_807999	World conquest is no laughing matter Mr. Lecoure. Show the respect that it is due or you'll find yourself exiled to dinner theater playing Willy Loman in some retirement town in Florida.

131039753581529_780762	I saw a sneak preview of this and it was absolutely hilarious!!! Also very sweet and cute. I think I might have to see it again when it's released in theaters. And Mathew- why you gotta hate on Twilight? Just because you think it's stupid doesn't mean you need to trash it on here where you might offend people who do like it. I see your pic is Toy Story. Maybe I think that's totally lame. Hmm?
131039753581529_781490	can't wait to see it! so excited!!
131039753581529_784889	im so excited you looser

126256134074645_697118	I much rather see unknown actors doing the voices for animated movies.  
126256134074645_698556	I saw the movie today!! Free movie pass. It was pretty good movie. It had good, evil, laughter and a great plot!!! I highly recremend anyone to see it!!! Also, the 3D was great too!!! Great family movie!!!
126256134074645_703935	@Ray I agree. Steve is beginning to annoy a bit being in everything. He's a great actor but he should stick to the office and work on very few things for a bit. Then when he is done with that he'd be awesome. He' making his career go down the drain with all the kids movies and not-so-funny comedies. Just m pinion though.
126256134074645_710923	I can't believe a few people are lucky and saw it already! I hope it beats the new Predators movie when it comes out.
126256134074645_744456	I saw this today with a free Advanced Screening pass.  My girls and I loved it.    I disagreee, I can't get enough of Steve Carell.  He's great in this!  It made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me laugh until I cried.

132733743406062_806302	go to programs and offers, u have to be a silver member
132733743406062_806323	It totally isn't mentioned at all on the site... T_T
132733743406062_806369	I got it :)  
132733743406062_806481	I signed in, but a Reward Zone Member is not a Premier Reward Zone Member, so It was not on the site for me to see either.
132733743406062_806487	Ah, so you have to be a higher rank. 
132733743406062_806527	Damn...no best buy near me *Sniffles.*
132733743406062_806546	2,500 spent in a year to be silver. Maybe if you bought a led tv or a top of the line computer. I bought a laptop, 2 cameras, zune, printer, several inks, dozens of dvds, video games and  a few gifts cards this year and I am not even close to 2,500. I guess I should have bought my television there. Yet, found it elsewhere for alot less. 
132733743406062_806561	I would love to win a free premiere ticket! Does that include a plane flight? Then I could visit my sister in LA and see an awesome movie :)
132733743406062_806566	Read the rest.. I use my brothers account an am not sure if he is a silver member :/

397760210162_12986571	I hadn't heard of this movie until I went to the movie theater last week and saw the huge display. The image + title made me really curious. It looks funny from the trailer. I wish there was a desktop image that looked like the display where Gru is standing with a bunch of minions.

397760210162_13001608	Cassie and her friend were at home with there older sister. Their older sister was planing on going out, and told them to not answer the door for anyone and to keep everything locked. Cassie and her friend went online looking at scary chain letters and laughing at how they weren't ever true. The didn... See More... See More... See More... See More... See More... See More’t believe in any of the chains and went to bed. Unfortunately, they forgot to lock the doors. Cassie’s friend had been murdered in the middle of the night. Quickly and frightened, Cassie went and reposted every chain letter they had read. After waking up in the morning she saw something that looked like a face that was very red staring back at her in the mirror. But did not see her face. She ran down stairs and looked in a different mirror. Still seeing the same face she touched hers. She then looked at her hand and it was covered in something red and watery. Her skin was burned and bloody. News around her town had told about the murder of Cassie’s friend. Cassie’s sister arrived home later that night, not yet seeing the news. Cassie told her sister what had happened and her sister was in denial. Her sister reported that Cassie had gone insane and put her into a Mental Hospital. Years past, and Cassie had died of a rare disease. Cassie came back for revenge towards her sister and the murderer. The murderer was never found. Nearly hours after Cassie’s revenge her sister was found dead. The man who found Cassie’s sister bloody with stab wounds on the floor spotted a faint, red, shadow. This was Cassie’s shadow. The man heard a whisper and he could make out small words saying “You didn’t see anything.”If you don’t repost this chain to at least 6 people in the next 10 minutes, Cassie will haunt you too. This is not fake. Don’t believe me? Read below.Case 1: Ashley Duran read this. She hates chains and ignored this. The next night, Ashley’s parents couldn’t find her. They could see blood in the shape of her body in her bed. Her mother killed herself and her father was guilty of murder.Case 2: Jessica saw this this chain. She posted it to just 5 people. Not good enough, Jessica. Not good enough. Jessica is currently in a coma and she may never wake up again... Case 3: Justin Carehard only read a little bit of the story. He didn’t post it at all. There have been searches for him. Nobody ever saw a fingerprint or anything. There is no sign of him. Almost as if he has vanished into thin air 1997 a girl named Lauren was walking in a forest and suddenly disappeared; she hadn't been discovered untill 2000 when a young girl named Mary found Lauren's body which had chest markings that said, "I wasn't pretty enough." Lauren's ghost will appear in your mirror, telling you that you're not pretty enough and she will kill you. She'll will repeatedly tell you" The same happened to Mary, and she died shortly...

397760210162_13055776	Does anybody know what the little girl's name is? I know the three girls names are Margo, Edith & Agnes but I don't know who is who!
397760210162_13102279	margo is the oldest who is voiced my miranda cosgrave. i dont know the other two though
397760210162_13108133	I'm guessing the littlest one is Agnes then. In a sentence about the movie it lists them as Margo, Edith & Agnes, so it seems that they would be in order of oldest to youngest.

111095132241010_191443	It's going to be very hard to resist a plushie Minion if I find him in Target.  Especially if he comes with a Moo toy.
111095132241010_192182	This movie keeps getting better and better! My favorite parts: Gru: Freeze ray! Freeze ray! Freeze ray!, Gru: Dave. Minion: (Sound) Minion: (Hits Minion), Gru: I sit on the toilet! Wait what?! Kids: (laugh) Little girl who looks more adorable than Russell from Up: Your funny!, Old person: We have to hold him, and fast! (Revs up his motorized wheelchair) (Moves slow) Minions: (Run away) Old person: (Still moves slow) Minions: (Walk back), Gru: Wow. This is garbage! Do you actually like this?, Gru: Okay, my turn! (Activates blaster) (Blasts stand) Not over! Little girl: It's so fluffy!, When one minion can't say the name of the movie and the other one helps him. Can't wait for July! I need a minion plush toy! And make come with that moo toy he had in the last trailer so I can have him!
111095132241010_194642	It's so fluffy!

402168047024_12441529	about 1 pm in the UK
402168047024_12441576	Tomorrow? Or been and gone. Sigh....either way I lose as I'm working tomorrow.
402168047024_12441629	sorry 1 am tonight
402168047024_12442002	Oh, I'm bound to still be up. I remember Miranda from "School of Rock", one of the best films of it's type in the last decade. Thanks Steven!
402168047024_12442074	agreed . . . i was at UIP when we distributed SoR . . . Tenacious D played the prem party . . . kerazzy
402168047024_12442308	Good ol' UIP! Hope you still get an honouary invite to the Paramount premieres! ;-)Was luck enough to meet Jack and KG backstage at a Tenacious D gig before they became huge. Bet that was one hell of a prem-party!
402168047024_12466162	She was very sweet but I knew when I saw the questions flashing up on the side panel of "What's your fave color?" and "What do you think of "Twilight"?" I was kinda in the wrong crowd, LOL! A bit like me going to Justin Beiber concert...without the gun that is!Not much "Despicable" talk either just about a Nickelodeon TV show she does and her music.Still, good luck to her either way!
402168047024_12967926	It's so fluffy!
402168047024_13184429	its so fluffy!
346374851134_12198837	I like this.
346374851134_12967549	I made mine and I named it Simon because he sounds just like him!
346374851134_13355613	I named mine "Vincent"! I love it!! 
346374851134_13366119	I made one and name him Dooda
346374851134_13384734	My minion is named 'Cry Baby'! He is so cute.

333546145162_12624440	Best trailer ever! The minions were playing around! Can't wait for a new trailer when it hits theaters Friday with How to Train Your Dragon! Can't wait for July!
333546145162_12948776	George Baker Selection?  Awesome.  If the sound track is as good as the music in the advertisements have been, this film is going to be money.
333546145162_12985667	This is cute
333546145162_12988778	I LOVE the bass line in the beginning, and the minions rule!
333546145162_13064164	it is so violent...alsome

234890667591_1932012	Loved the first trailer, loved the second... HATE the minions. God I wanna be wrong here - but thus far, the promotions and trailer for them make absolutely no sense. And considering how very little we know about the actual storyline to begin with, seems like a bit of a red flag. Here's hoping I'm wrong.
234890667591_1940927	I think the minions are hilarious.  Can't wait to see more.
