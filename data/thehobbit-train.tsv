positive	Let's kick off with the score I've given it. 5/10. That's for the reasonable job with the comedy, design, and things not related to story and pacing (with the exception of Gollum and the cave scene).
mutual	I was convinced the (many) criticisms I read beforehand were exaggerated and wouldn't bother me. To my surprise, quite some criticisms seemed justified in the end ...
negative	Peter Jackson's return to the world of Tolkien is rather weak. At first I was against the idea of such a small book being made into a trilogy. I still am.
positive	Best of the best. Pete has crafted a masterpiece. I should say at this point, I am a new fan of LOTR movies after seeing this movie.
positive	First of all, let me first say that while I enjoyed the LOTR trilogy, and admired the directorial and technical greatness of it, I'm no LOTR fanboy, and I also recognize its flaws.
negative	"All great stories deserve a little embellishment." So says Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) in the most telling line in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, Peter Jackson's return to the world of JRR Tolkien.
negative	First came the original trilogy, a popular success and critically acclaimed. Then, some years later, a second trilogy began, a prequel to the original, and the first installment of this second trilogy turned out to be awful.
negative	I was about 8 years old when I was first introduced to the Hobbit from the animated 1 hour movie. The movie was a yearly event. As a child, it freaked me out. But, my Dad loved Glenn Yarbrough and the music, so, I was made to sit through it.
negative	THE QUALITY OF THE FILM Imagine "Spy Kids" with elements of Tolkien's writing. Technological demonstration, a large budget at the hands of a tasteless creative group.
positive	I was a mere child when I watched LOTR franchise and I still liked it. Ever since, year by year, I grew fonder and fonder of the movies and they remain, and probably forever will, one of my favorite movies of all time.
positive	The movie is amazing. It is unlike anything I've ever experienced in a cinema. The vividness of the colors and light and movement is something to behold.
negative	If misstepping were an aerobic exercise, Peter Jackson would be in excellent shape. Although I am loath to admit it, this adaptation of "The Hobbit" is unsatisfactory in many, many ways.
negative	This is the first of three films Peter Jackson has made to adapt J.R.R. Tolkien's prequel to Lord of the Rings.
positive	The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey brings back the magic of Middle Earth, but I think it's unfortunate that it will experience the inevitable comparison to The Lord of the Ring
positive	Some love stories are built on passion, some on courage and some on hope. Very rarely do you come across a love story that encompasses itself around a journey.
negative	I am bitterly disappointed by this film. It's noisy, jumbled, and chaotic, far too violent (it was a children's book, for heaven's sake!), and almost completely formless.
mutual	Watched the IMAX 3D HFR version.
positive	Firstly, I have to make a statement- the LOTR movies, for me, have set an impossibly high bar both in this universe and within the movie world as a whole. Their cinematic beauty and value cannot be denied.
positive	This movie was so EPIC i'm speechless. I went with high expectations because Peter Jackson is awesome, but man, they weren't high ENOUGH.
negative	What a disappointment ! While I watched all LOTR movies with great enjoyment, this one is just a movie created to fill someone's pockets.
mutual	On learning that The Hobbit, a 400 page children's book was to be extended over three films (Unexpected Journey being the first) it seemed Peter Jackson may have been seeking a compromise between the children friendly book and the more darker and foreboding LOTR trilogy.
negative	The movie starts out as a warm return to middle-earth, we get a nice background-story of how the dwarfs lost their hometown, Erebor, to Smaug, the gold-seeking dragon.
positive	"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey" simultaneously takes director Peter Jackson in two different directions. While at first glance it may seem that he is travelling over familiar ground, again tackling the fantastical world of J.
positive	A shortish book is drawn out to not one but three full-length feature films, the better to flesh out characters who need, uh, fleshing, and the better to tell every bit of the tale.
negative	The Hobbit is absolutely terrible. Maybe the most uninspired musical I've ever seen. Its like they reshot the lord of the rings with a veneer of hobbit overlaid on top.
mutual	The Hobbit suffers from all the faults of LOTR but to a greater degree.
positive	First off I have never read The Hobbit, but from what I gather the book isn't all that long, so the fact that this film is the first of three, suggests they may be milking it a little.
positive	I absolutely adored LORD OF THE RINGS especially the first film Fellowship Of The Ring and when it was announced THE HOBBIT was going to be turned in to a film I looked forward .
mutual	Okay, I'm a big fan of the LOTR franchise. I was eagerly awaiting this movie and looking forward to seeing it. Maybe I was expecting too much, but I found it a colossal disappointment in multiple areas.
negative	Martin Freeman plays young Bilbo Baggins who's been given the role of Burglar in a quest to reclaim some hill once exploited by The Dwarfs that since long has been domiciled by a nasty dragon named Smaug.
negative	When I first heard that Peter Jackson had decided to make "The Hobbit" into three movies I was rather surprised. "The Hobbit" is not a long or complex book.
negative	The Hobbit SUCKED. It's like Star Wars Episode 1, all effects, no character development or emotional content. No charm, no magic.
negative	Everyone expected The Hobbit to be a different movie from LOTR. LOTR is dark and sombre. The Hobbit is a children's book, albeit one that appeals to adults. We were expecting a lighter movie. What we got was a mess.
negative	I've read a lot of the reviews here and a lot of them have spot on information. So, I will keep this short and sweet:
negative	The Hobbit is a relatively short book written as a prequel to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It is NOT a trilogy, and even though LOTR is comfortably presented as a trilogy, it was written to be one very long book in three parts.
negative	OK, that's what happens if you let a soulless illiterate with no knowledge nor respect like Peter Jackson direct a Nobel-winner's book into a movie.
negative	I was very disappointed by this movie and surprised by just how awful it was. I say this as someone who loves LOTR.
negative	The joy of reading the Hobbit is that it's a humble and somewhat gentle tale for children. Quite why Jackson et al have decided to turn it into a 3 episode overblown epic is unknown.
negative	The Lord of the Rings trilogy has always been heavy reading, a very somber story. But The Hobbit is much lighter reading and quite humorous.
negative	Often we are compelled to do something we wouldn't usually do due to a rush of emotion and indeed, writing my first film review is accompanied by sorrow, anger and disappointment.
negative	First, let me say the Lord of the Rings movies were all first-rate and stayed pretty close to the original Tolkien books. Unfortunately, The Hobbit is not, because it does not.
mutual	This is not a bad film. But it is not the film people are describing. The Hobbit is a children's book of approximately 300 pages.
negative	Oh boy, what a failure. An Unexpected Journey never even seems to start and the writing, which had to rely far more on original material than the first three movies shows the weakness of Jackson et al. They can hardly write at all it seems - the dialogue and humor is painful.
negative	I have to wonder if I saw the same film as some of the other reviewers...
negative	I saw the 48 frames per second, 3D version and at least in my cinema it looked crap. The 3D looked artificial, the colors were poor, and the image lacked sharpness. And of course it was 3 hours of this.
negative	Tolkien must be spinning in his grave. This movies bears absolutely no resemblance to the book, aside from the names of the characters and the general plot.
negative	Just saw "The Hobbit" in 2D and standard 24 fps. There is some good to be said about this movie: Many set-designs and landscape shots are quite beautiful (in case you missed the same set-designs and landscape shots in the Lord Of The Rings trilogy).
negative	This movie was really disappointing. Let me say that although I didn't read the LOTR books, I loved the movies. However, I did read The Hobbit.
negative	WARNING, will likely contain spoilers!
mutual	First to say, I'm a true fan of The Lord of the Rings trilogy.
positive	The Lord of the Rings has been a timeless epic classic that is hard for other fantasy, Tolkien wannabe movies to capture its magic and so far, director Peter Jackson is probably the only one who can capture it.
mutual	We waited until this weekend to see "The Hobbit", to let the crowds die down, so what I'm saying has probably already been said by several others. Still, let me put in my two cents' worth...
negative	Although The Hobbit was by far my favorite childhood book, Peter Jackson managed to turn it into the worst movie that I have ever seen.
positive	This is not going to be one of those long reviews, consisting of detailed writings about what was good or wrong, that is for you to decide, once it hits the cinemas.
negative	..yes the characters and the settings are good and Lord of the rings was riveting, but this . I am sorry Muppet Show in a big cave ... The action scenes are like Tom and Jerry.
negative	On the whole it wouldn't be bad, but the original story is vanishing in the flood of fight scenes. And it's way too much.
mutual	From the very beginning, "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey" seemed to be missing something. Despite an all-too-brief appearance by Frodo and the return of several "Lord of the Rings" characters (Bilbo, Gandalf, and others), the story never became very compelling.
positive	Xarnis's review: It seems I'm in the minority here, but I like this movie. I don't know of its because i've read The Hobbit, the trilogy, and the Silmarillion, or what.
positive	Beautiful cinematography, beautiful design, make-up, special effects. Everything is perfect. The cast is a joy to watch.
positive	The Hobbit has always been the little brother book of The Lord of the Rings. However, in their movie version, it feels the other way around.
mutual	While I admit to preferring the book versions of most works, I am not a literalist. Movies such as L.A.
mutual	If this and KING KONG are what Peter Jackson are capable of when he's given free rein, then someone please bring back the bit and bridle.
positive	I will say upfront that I enjoyed this film. As a definite fan of the LOTR series, it was nice to see many of the characters again in a different adventure.
positive	I have seen the movie four times: once in 2D and three times in 3D 48fps. More on technology issues at the end of the review. Now let me discuss the movie itself.
positive	Returning to Middle Earth felt a bit like a school reunion. I was pleased to be back, but slightly embarrassed and curiously unconcerned about former acquaintances. Two screenings caused me to wish they had left Tolkien's book well alone.
positive	It is the first time in my life when I can say that a movie is better that the book! Very good story, impressive special effects and a great sound make "The hobbit, an unexpected journey" a must see!
mutual	I don't know what is with Hollywood these days. They continue to turn out trash for movies or they create these nearly 3 hour movies thinking that longer is better.
positive	As this film opens an elderly Bilbo Baggins explains how the once great Dwarfs were forced out of their mountain kingdom by the dragon Smaug.
positive	Ten years ago, I laid eyes on Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, and instantly fell in love.
positive	As an avid movie watcher, I was very excited to hear two years ago that The Hobbit was indeed going to be filmed.
negative	Bilbo recast as RAMBO.
negative	Saw The Hobbit last night and was very disappointed. Having read The Hobbit & LOTR in the 70's and re-read a couple of times since I really enjoyed LOTR because they were as true as possible to the books.
mutual	I and some of my family went to see this last weekend and left the theater sorely disappointed. All of us had read The Hobbit during our teen years and complained to each other afterward that the movies dialog and recreation of events from the book were quite a bit off.
mutual	First off: "The Hobbit - an unexpected journey" looks absolutely amazing on a big screen, especially when viewed through 3D glasses.
negative	Before I start, let me first say that I LOVE the books... The Hobbit and the three that make up LOTR.
mutual	Missing The Lord of the Rings trilogy in the cinema is one of my biggest film related regrets. Granted, when I finally saw them a few years later, I dragged myself through a Fellowship and Two Towers VHS and couldn't stand them.
negative	As much as I was looking forward to this film, I have to say it is by no means brilliant. The only thing that kept me in my seat in the cinema was the hope that it would remain as faithful to the book as it does in the beginning for the remainder of the film. Sadly, not so.
negative	Despite many deviation from the books, I enjoyed The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy (especially the first movie).
negative	I hated pretty much everything about this movie, but here are the main points:
positive	My conclusion upon watching this film and talking to others about it, is that if you are a fan of the Tolkien Universe, and not just the individual stories, then you will be a fan of this movie.
negative	This movie is bad. Really bad. About the only good thing I can say about it is that I am not being forced to watch it now. Oh, and Gollum was done reasonably well I suppose, as far as that goes.
positive	I am a huge movie buff and also a huge Lord of the Rings fan. So, when I heard that director Peter Jackson was finally directing the Hobbit, I immediately ordered my ticket!
positive	The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the first installment of a projected three-film adaptation of JRR Tolkien's "the Hobbit", the first fantasy book written by Tolkien taking place in the mythical "Middle Earth".
mutual	My friends and I go to the Cinema almost every week , all 3 loved LotR, all 3 thought this movie was a waste of time , literally a waste of time on account of the first hour , nothing happening at all.
mutual	OK, not a complete miss but it was not what I was led to believe it was going to be.
negative	I watched this movie in 3D HFR. If you find 3D movies dim of light and a headache, you will not find any improvement in this new tech.
negative	About a decade ago, Peter Jackson concluded his film adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy and swept the awards with "The Return of the King".
negative	far too long, drawn out and boring. I actually got up and walked away for a bit to get some fresh air then came back and watched the rest.
mutual	I am a Tolkien fan having read LOTRs and The Hobbit many times (over 20). I loved Peter Jackson's LOTRs trilogy despite his skateboarding Legolas and slapstick version of Gimli. Gollum was one of the greatest characterisations I have ever seen.
positive	Hobbit Unexpected Journey is in my opinion an average movie. I just don't get it why people would consider it to be one of the greatest movie ever made. There are several reasons in mind:
positive	Well, I don't want to write too much. But all I must say here is that I didn't expect anything from this movie due to the buzz and sheer disappointment of some critical reviews that I read.
positive	i liked this movie it has what you may want from a fantasy action drama but compared to the lord of the rings trilogy well sadly it fails,what really went wrong with the hobbit ?
negative	OK, to be fair this is not a 1/10 movie. But it is so far from being a 10/10 and a top 250 movie that I felt the need to make a point.
negative	Wasn't impressed, not in the least.
positive	I thought the Lord of the Rings trilogy was excellent!! So, when "The Hobbit" came out, I was extremely eager to see the film... until I started reading reviews. Life got in the way of me seeing the movie in theatre, but I ordered my copy on Blu-Ray.
positive	Tolkien's "The Lord of the Rings" is a mighty epic fantasy, well over a thousand pages in length in most editions. Although Tolkien intended it to be a single novel, his publishers, for commercial reasons, issued it as a trilogy.
mutual	The Hobbit is an enjoyable enough movie, although it's too long. This is a children's book, it doesn't need endless LOTR tie-ins and the other additional material.
positive	I went to see the Hobbit last night, I walked into the cinema afraid that the film wouldn't be very good, at least compared with The Lord of the Rings. I was very wrong.
positive	So this is my first time writing a review on IMDb so I'm going to warn everyone that this may contain spoilers!
positive	I Wasn't really exited about this movies since the second I heard they were making three of them, from ONE amazing book, then hearing it'll include other stories was too much for any purist J.
positive	Watched 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' last week - and loved it. Great to be transported to Middle-earth and get reacquainted with some familiar faces - and meet many new ones too.
positive	I've only seen it in 24 fps so far. I'm never a big fan of 3-D movies, but I wouldn't mind seeing 2D 48 fps.
positive	For me this movie is a perfect fairytale movie that I wish I could have watched back when I was a kid. I am a grown man now but watching this movie took me back to my childhood.
positive	The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is an amazing movie! It's a great movie for the whole family. Full of amazing characters, great scenery, great action and great comedy.
negative	I thought this movie was so bad, much like Jackson's King Kong was really bad. It was SO overlong that I sat in the movie theater and pondered when it would end.
mutual	Let me start by saying The Hobbit was casted incredibly well. Martin Freeman was the perfect Bilbo, mostly due to his comedic timing with a good balance of heart as well (similar to Pipin & Merry in LOTR) that would have made the film to heavy otherwise.
positive	This is one of the movies that you either enjoy as a whole and try to overlook the negatives, or you be put off by its flaws, luckily .. I was among the first group.
positive	It's been nine years since Peter Jackson ended his epic retelling of J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings saga, which in its lifetime garnered billions of dollars in worldwide gross, and won a combined total of 17 Academy Awards, including Best Picture for Return of the King.
mutual	I looked forward to the Hobbit with a sense of enthusiasm. I liked the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and forgave the examples where the films diverged from the book.
mutual	There is no denying that a production of The Hobbit has been a highly anticipated event ever since Peter Jackson and his team first began producing the Lord of the Rings trilogy just over a decade ago.
negative	After the LotR trilogy, my hopes weren't exactly high when I heard that Jackson was doing the Hobbit as well. They shrank even more when I heard that instead of two films, there was going to be three.
negative	The owners of the film rights of Tolkien's legacy naturally hope that each new instalment they provide will satisfy every demographically analysed sub-section of the massive potential cash cow (I mean audience).
negative	What an enigma this movie is. A great movie will have pages of positive reviews and high ratings, with an occasional negative comment here and there if appropriate. The Hobbit, however, has generated comments from both ends of the spectrum, from awesome to awful, and ratings from 1-10!
negative	You can tell by my rating that I didn't like this movie, but let's be fair. Despite my overall negative view of it, I still found some gems which are so good that I just can't bring myself to not mention them.
negative	8.5?! 94th on the top 250 movies of ALL TIME?! I found myself bored half ways through.
positive	I went to watch this movie with hope it would be another masterpiece by Peter Jackson like the trilogy Lord of the Rings. I was aware that the story and characters were going to be different but there was no need for such a different film  and not in a good way!
negative	The main problem with The Hobbit, as far as I can see it, is that it strays so ridiculously far from the original.
negative	I was a little sceptical going in as to how they could milk a 300 page book into three films (and long films too, dear God, this was long!).
mutual	I'm going to say upfront that the visuals were great and the 3D felt worth it for this film. The visuals and cinematography were the best I've seen since Avatar. However, it felt to be lacking in every other instance.
negative	I really wanted to like this film but it was absolutely dreadful. The HFR issue is a complete red herring; it's just a really bad film.
positive	I remember how bringing The Lord of the Rings to the screen proved difficult due to the sheer quantity of material offered in the literary template. The trilogy was a logical choice, yet even then a lot of condensing was needed.
mutual	I'm having difficulty sitting through these recent Peter Jackson films without getting bored out of my mind.
positive	When they announced The Hobbit would be made into a trilogy I thought it was a bad idea and after watching a Unexpected Journey I still think it was a bad idea.
mutual	There are two separate things I want to touch upon in this review. First is how it feels to return to Middle Earth and sit through yet another epic 2 hour 50 minute journey.
positive	The Lord of the Rings movies are some of my favourite films of all time, and The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey comes close, but a few problems hold it back from being truly fantastic.
positive	I tried defending this film to my friends after seeing this. I told them that it's based on a children's book and is supposed to be whimsical.
mutual	I approached The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey with trepidation, fearful that Peter Jackson, a director whose career was born of excess, would go unnecessarily way over the to
positive	*** Warning, this review may contain a spoiler ***
positive	Beyond the height of quality to expect from these creators (the ones also of the lord of the rings), The Hobbit an unexpected journey is a true middle-earth adventure that is a wonderful place to re-visit.
positive	First of all: what was with the singing? The Hobbit was very much parallel to the LOTR trilogy in regard to storyline and setup (meet, different battles, let's meet the dwarfs, let's meet the elves).
positive	THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY
negative	Let me open by saying that I totally enjoyed the Lord of the Rings trilogy and watched all three parts a total of four times to date. I savoured the texture and sheer quality of almost every aspect of these works.
negative	First off: I was very excited about this movie. Being a LOTR fan, I was expecting something grand.
mutual	Padding. Padding padding padding.
mutual	Peter Jackson's The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a fantastic movie, but only if you've read the Silmarillion and drew obscene pictures of elves as a kid.
mutual	...and if it weren't for the top-rank design and effects, I'd have likely never gotten through it. As it is, it took me three days.
negative	I have to say, as a die-hard fan of the books, that this movie was blown for me in the first 20 minutes.
mutual	I am a life long fan of Tolkien. I've read The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings trilogy countless times. Needless to say I was excited when the Lord of the Rings was made into a movies, or I should say, movies.
negative	I liked the movie L.O.T.R., i liked the novel The Hobbit. I watched this movie with curiosity how the charme and the esprit of this great novel would be adapted.
negative	If I didn't know anything about The Hobbit, and saw this film, I might have rated it a 7 of 10... i.e. not a great film, but fairly entertaining.
positive	After the critical acclaim and commercial success of the Lord of the Rings movies, it was somewhat inevitable that the Hobbit would also be given the big screen treatment.
positive	Firstly I have to say that I actually think the hobbit is not a well written book. In my opinion too much is left unsaid both in regards to characters and plot.
positive	Good adaptation of Tolkien's book, well-fitting with the earlier Lord of the Rings films. Overall very satisfying. The visual sweep and grandeur of this film conveys everything I would expect from a filmic adaptation of Tolkien.
positive	I know there are loads of these types of threads already, before I watched the movie I looked at them and everyone was complaining...
negative	Now I'm just as happy watching a slow burn film as an all action epic, but this felt like Peter Jackson had spent 3 hours rubbing two sticks together and failed to get a single glow.
positive	I went to see the Hobbit with not much expectation of seeing Great Story. I already knew that the special effects and imagery would be beyond comparison. The acting would be very high-class.
mutual	I almost fall asleep the first 45 minutes, the post production should have reduced the first minutes so nobody gets bored. A movie in which you start bored will be a difficult to like one. The movie should have been at least 30 minutes shorter. Nothing new, the 3 previous ones where much better.
mutual	Peter Jackson directing another Middle Earth movie? I was pumped. My disappointment started almost immediately, and never recovered.
mutual	Expectedly comparisons must be made between this film and its predecessor, THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING.
positive	The fact that this movie took almost 3 hours of my life and I didn't even flinch while watching it, multiplied by 4 (times watching it) .. says a lot.
positive	I'll try to keep this review short and sweet. I'm not a huge LOTR fan like some. I've never read the books and I've seen the first trilogy only one time each (and I did think they were great). But what I am is a movie fanatic/sci fi fan, and movies like The Hobbit are hard to pass up.
positive	I felt this movie held up to the standards the Lord of the Rings had in place. After reading the book, they didn't stay strictly by the book. They strayed but the stayed true to the feel of it.
negative	Two more sequels to this? Good luck keeping the audience awake. Why? Well, let's start with stretching a single story into 3 movies 7-9 hours long.
positive	The Hobbit is very different from the LOTR (Lord of the Rings) trilogy. This is filled with humor that has the whole crowd laughing, where Lord of the Rings trilogy is more serious.
mutual	As a massive fan of the Lord of the Rings saga and reader of all the books I must say I was very disappointed with this new film.
positive	I'm a big fan of Tolkien and I am really glad to see the Hobbit on the screen; nonetheless, I have to say turning the Hobbit into a trilogy is not a flawless idea.
positive	I have seen this movie twice, on opening night in IMAX 3D and again half a month later, again in IMAX 3D, and both times I have Been thrilled with nearly 3 hours of pure imagination, creativity and excellence.
positive	Watching this movie, I wasn't sure what to expect. After LOTR, coming up with anything even close to it, seemed a gargantuan task, even for Peter Jackson!
positive	I will try to make a concise overview of the movie without analyzing it deeply and technically. First of all, I am a great fan of Hobbit and LOTR series.
mutual	First,I'm a huge LOTR fan but did not enjoy the Hobbit as much as any of the LOTR movies.
mutual	Those who thought Christopher Tolkien had a very deep economic interest in his father's heritage (Sell-a-million) can officially claim that Peter Jackson has now outdone him, and by far.
positive	I personally think the Lord of the Rings trilogy is the epitome of film-making of the last 10 years. For three consecutive years, I turned myself in a rabid fanboy of everything LOTR, source literature included.
positive	The wonder of a good walk is the wonder of these stories about our shared journey. It may not always look like the places we have been, but it sure feels like it on the journey.
negative	I created an Account on IMDb just to Post my Review of this horrible movie.
mutual	In one of the 'Making of..." interviews for Lord of the Rings, Peter Jackson pointed out that "this movie really needs to be made by someone who understands special effects, otherwise the special effects can easily overwhelm the story" (I'm paraphrasing), and then did exactly that in the Hobbit.
negative	Why must the makers of adventure-films feel the need to make their films constantly epic and weighed down with suspense?? It ends up being nonsense.
negative	My background is mixed: I loved LOTR and thought it was an exemplary execution of the epic journey genre. I am also a video engineer in L.A., and hated The Hobbit in its book form.
mutual	Peter Jackson and his screenwriters really dropped the ball on this film. I felt it started out fairly Tolkienesque, but upon leaving the Shire, it is one long downhill diversion from what the man wrote.
negative	This movie is Peter Jackson at his worst. It is King Kong with dwarfs. If you thought Legolas shield surfing and killing oliphants was bad, you haven't seen anything yet. This movie was so bad I was swearing at Peter Jackson for the last 45 minutes.
negative	Well, the number of positive reviews is both disconcerting and ill-informative of reality. This movie was, by both LOTR and general standards alike, an atrocity.
positive	Storyline: The Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins is coerced into going on a fantastical adventure with Gandalf the wizard and 13 Dwarfs. In there travels they meet an assortment of creatures.
mutual	I was truly disappointed by this movie, although I could have seen it coming based on the decision to split up this (short) story in tree 3-hour movies.
mutual	Going into The Hobbit, it was always going to be about expectations. I must admit my expectations were very low. However, I went in with an open mind.
negative	What the hell is this?
positive	Since many reviews have already been written and almost everything has been said on the matter, I have decided to list the most frequent complaints brought up by the reviewers and discuss them (of course not ad personam, but in general terms).
mutual	I'm reluctant to admit that I hardly enjoyed, or was entertained by, this grossly overly computerized revisit to Middle Earth.
negative	I watched this in 3D and I'd have to say, the graphics is as real as it gets. Absolutely stunning, I can't imagine how many CG artists have worked on the amazing details of the 3D models.
mutual	I will do my best to keep this review short, like the story Tolkien created, NOT like Peter Jackson is doing by making this into a trilogy.
negative	First things first, I'm not against the fact that Peter Jackson and co. decided to stretch one book into three movies, after all it's the movie BUSINESS and it is of course and industry, so, no harm no foul.
mutual	The Hobbit tries hard, and a lot of the time gets it perfectly right. Character scenes translate well from the book, Middle Earth is presented beautifully, and Bilbo is great. I was expecting a wonderful film based on the early scenes.
mutual	Peter Jackson turns one of the greatest books of all time in to an action movie, consisting primarily of anonymous dwarfs somehow avoiding death, while being attacked by various enemies including wargs, trolls, goblins, Klingons, zombies, whatever.
mutual	When the lights go out there are 9 minutes of cheap-looking CGI with voice-over story telling. Then "The Hobbit" starts. From here the movie seems to move at the same speed as reading a book.
mutual	A group of fantasy figures go on a quest across a dangerous landscape to a great high mountain, meeting and fighting a range of fantastical creatures on the way.
negative	since this is my first IMDb review, i'll keep it short - this movie is simply bad: too long, too boring, too much CGI, no character development, WAY too many pointless scenes, dialogs, and even pointless characters and cameo appearances...
negative	I saw the normal 24 fps non 3D version of The Hobbit so I have nothing to say about the quality of the controversial 48fps version or the 3D version.
mutual	The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the extremely highly anticipated prequel to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It is the first part of the story of Bilbo "the Dildo" Baggins, and how he helped the dwarfs reclaim their city from the dragon Smaug.
positive	There seems to be an element out there that are afraid that IMDb is going to rank a movie too high. That it is their duty to give films low scores, rather than an honest appraisal.
positive	Nice quality film, but it lasts too long. A lot of stuff is not based on the book, which is fine as long as it doesn't hold up the actual story line.
mutual	I read The Hobbit almost 40 years ago. I don't recall it that well, but I do remember a small, charming adventure story with an appealingly unsure protagonist and a really cool creature called Gollum.
positive	Amazing. Simply Amazing. For those fans of the Lord of the Rings Movies, there are the hints of impending Darkness.
positive	I thought it had a very good storyline to go off of and the world was very fascinating and grabbed my attention.
positive	I went to see this film with really low expectations after all of the really bad criticisms, but I have to say after watching it I was extremely happy.
positive	I went into the Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey knowing full well what Peter Jackson and his team had to live up to. I wasn't expecting it to be as good as the Lord of the Rings because in my opinion the book isn't as good but the film impressed me none the less.
positive	I must admit I'm not a loyal fan of either J.R.R. Tolkien's or Peter Jackson's work. I've read "The Hobbit" and "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy long time ago, and haven't even finished watching Jackson's adaptations.
mutual	I am so disappointed. Jackson turned this great classic story into 3 boring hours of meaningless conflict that dragged on and on and on. He could have told the entire Hobbit in one film!
mutual	I've been a fan of Tolkien, the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings forever. And I never would have thought there could possibly be anything to shake my fascination, my enthrallment with it all.
positive	"I'm looking for someone to share in an adventure."
positive	Firstly I did not come to Tolkien via the films, but from reading The Hobbit aged about 13 and dozens of times since. Lord of the Rings, again aged 13, about seven or eight times since, Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales and just about everything else Tolkien wrote including academic papers.
positive	The Hobbit is a really good book, the Lord of the Rings is a much better book. LOTR is truly an Epic adventure having to do with the fate of all of Middle Earth.
negative	Complete and utter garbage.
negative	Okay, this movie is plain bad. I'm not saying this because I'm a fanboy, even though I am, I'm saying this because it's just bad. What's wrong with it? Well, there's a lot of things.
negative	Its taken me just under a week to finish watching this on and off Meh!
mutual	Compared to LOTR this is a major disappointment. As one who bought LOTR on blu-ray in their extended editions because of the magnificent quality of the films it is hard for me to accept such a follow-up effort.
mutual	It takes a little while, but eventually this movie does make the prospect of seeing more in the series interesting. Roughly 30 odd minutes.
positive	I have seen the previous movie and TV incarnations of The Hobbit  huge, horrible messes, and could never figure out why they were so bad.
positive	Almost a decade after the end of the LOTR trilogy we have the Hobbit! A book that is Tolkien's as the others. I saw the movie with an inspective eye because of the previous three.
mutual	I gave 6 because of the riddle scene. The rest is a bore. I almost fell in sleep in a 3D IMAX cinema...Also, 3D itself seems unnecessary. Nothing really that stunning happened in it. The visual effects look quite mediocre.
mutual	The movie is a bit disappointing. This split in 3 parts seems like a big commercial thing. The rhythm get slower because of this, and the movie which is good looses interest.
mutual	A plain 2D version at the local multiplex, culminating my not-so-frenetic film-viewing activity of 2012.
positive	There is a lot of mixed reviews about 'The Hobbit'. It was what I expected, Average and watchable. Being a prequel it was not as good as the 'Lord of the Rings' however with to more films of the series to come I hope it can redeem itself.
positive	Well, I was in two minds to watch the Hobbit. One, I was not sure if this would have the thrills and adventure like the Lord of the Rings trilogy but it is still being directed by Peter Jackson.
positive	The perfect visual impression, excellent music and great scenery are fully anticipated positives of the last Jackson's movie adaptation of Tolkien's works, but that is, more or less, where the positives stop.
mutual	Summarizing my thoughts on the movie (may contain SPOILERS): Seeing the "An Unexpected Journey" made me realize that they should have sticked with the two movie plan.
mutual	This was the first time for me in a cinema, to get SO bored that i really wanted to leave.
positive	The LOTR trilogy which came out in movie theaters 11 years ago is one of the best trilogies and most successful of them ever made. So to say that The Hobbit movies coming out has a little bit to live up to would be a very big understatement.
positive	I have seen the Hobbit three times now and each time I find something new and my delight in the movie continues to grow.
mutual	this is what happens when you don't focus enough on character development and have a thin storyline. I was so disappointed, but it you never follow up the best trilogy in history with a knockout.
positive	It will doubtless come as no surprise to you that I'm a fan of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings (no one was more delighted than me when The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King won its Best Picture Oscar, and well deserved it was!
positive	I'm not too sure why there is so much hate for the Hobbit. Its clearly an adaptation of the book, not the actual book itself. And it also incorporates detail from the other stories written by Tolkien, ie.
negative	Taking one book and splitting it up into a new trilogy set in Tolkien's Middle Earth, Peter Jackson has returned us to the world he established on screen in The Lord of the Ri
negative	I don't know if it's more a commentary on the United States or Peter Jackson. This was the most disgusting, vile, shameful, disappointing, drivel I have wasted 2 hours trying twice now to watch.
negative	The Lord of the Rings (LOTR) movie trilogy ranks among my all-time favorite movies and I had been eagerly awaiting The Hobbit ever since I heard that Peter Jackson (the director of the LOTR trilogy) would be directing The Hobbit.
negative	The new characters are not as 3 dimensional. I didn't find myself really caring about them. Some of the dwarfs are Muppet-like and goofy in how they looked.
positive	After a fall of underwhelming cinematic fare, I had long-anticipated a film that would condone going to the theaters. Fortunately, one existed.
negative	It was always clear that THE HOBBIT, being by far the lesser book, would also make the lesser movie. It simply lacks the depth, the drama, the humanity, the strong characters, and relationships of LOTR.
negative	- Oh, should I've told you, that we got giant fkin birds? - No problem at all, not that we were almost get killed like a dozen times.
mutual	WARNING: Probably not the best review in the world... just venting my frustration. :)
mutual	Going in to the Hobbit, I had certain expectations based on Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy.
positive	This movie, the first in the Hobbit series, is an artistic masterpiece. I loved every second of the the "LORD OF THE RINGS" film series. Peter Jackson has done an outstanding job bringing Tolkein's classic book, the "HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY" to the screen.
mutual	A few dwarfs survive to regroup and take back their kingdom. If fantasy adventure is your genre, this Hobbit deliveries.
positive	I enjoyed this movie to the max. Peter Jackson really outdid himself there. The Hobbit is a movie prequel to The Lord of the Rings, dealing with Bilbo (Martin Freeman), who was tricked into having a party at his abode.
negative	An unexpected journey, indeed.
negative	I would like to send a message to Peter and crew: Too much of anything is good for nothing.
negative	I was really excited to see this. I enjoyed the Lord of the Rings Trilogy very much. First however, let's talk about the good.
mutual	I love the Lord of the Rings films, I have read the books, I enjoy fantasy genre in general. And why in the name of everything that is holy was The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey boring, nearly sleep inducing film?
positive	Be warned,this review contains many spoilers,although i will try not to get too much into details.
mutual	There is a great film within this film. If Peter Jackson comes to his senses, perhaps he will create a "Shortened Director's Cut" instead of an "Extended Edition.
mutual	ABOUT THE FILMS MAKING. seen as Jackson said the hobbit would be in 2parts as its such a big book. and then he puts the behind the scenes making of on you-tube to watch for months and years.
negative	This movie is blasphemy for everyone that read anything by Tolkien. Special effects and costumes does NOT make movie great, that is what for video games are, awful story but good effects are for games.
negative	After Lord of the Rings I expected something much better. The first hour seems like never ending. Than, a bit of action here and there but nothing special.
negative	The graphics are great, but...
negative	Before watching the hobbit, I had read a few reviews of it, mainly here on IMDb, saying its very accurate to the book. Sounds wonderful I thought, having loved the book the Hobbit, way more than I liked the others of J.R.R Tolkien.
negative	Poor Tolkien. Poor Peter Jackson. I am so sorry to see the result of this work. The bankruptcy and budget issues around this production is evident and made me realise how wonderful The Lord of Rings is.
negative	The Hobbit is truly horrible. It has zero good dialog, zero decent writing, nothing interesting or worthy of a Tolkien book whatsoever.
negative	Possible spoilers.
negative	Yes i felt like i got The Chronicles of Narnia. The reason i feel like that is because overall i thought the movie was way too childish.
positive	Thanks to the mixed reviews that dented my expectations from this film quite heavily, The Hobbit turned out to be an absolute feast for the eyes and is one hell of an on-screen adaptation of the classic novel.
positive	I am a big fan of JRR Tolkien's work, both of the books and of the previous Lord of the Rings movies. Thus, I went to see this film with high expectations. Overall, I was pleased with the film.
negative	Other people gave this movie only 1 star because they wanted to lower its current rating. Not me. This movie was such a pain in the ass that I barely made it till the end!
positive	I'm going to give it a 10 basically to spite the moron that gave it a 1 to "balance" the score. Give it the score you think it deserves, not something to spite the overall tally. You can think for yourself. The overall score doesn't matter. It's a personal review.
positive	I was a big fan of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, it felt like it had been so long since I had experienced a movie like the series.
mutual	It's a mixed bag, but as a fan of LOTR this film was a bit of a disappointment for me.
negative	Unfortunately this is one of those movies that no matter how many people tell you how bad it is you just have to see for yourself. I wish that on this occasion however I had listened to what I had heard.
mutual	The Hobbit: One of the oddest films I've seen. To start with it couldn't settle on a tone between dark fantasy epic, and annoyingly broad slapstick comedy with two musical numbers in the first hour. It was irritating to me.
negative	The joy of reading the Hobbit is that it's a humble and somewhat gentle tale for children. Quite why Jackson et al have decided to turn it into a 3 episode overblown epic is unknown.
negative	Underwhelmed in 9/10 ways... It's all been intelligently and passionately stated by those more credible and insightful than myself.
mutual	From a spectator point of view, it is a poignant and enjoyable film. The image is perfect, effects are great, music very good, although some clichés here and there (dragon opens eye - boom - frightening music effect). A few scenes (the dwarfs arriving at Bag End and ensuing party) are wonderful.
mutual	This movie lasts 169 minutes. About half of this time is wasted for some annoying computer generated 3D images. 10 or 20 minutes more are left for stunning views of mountains. Which I actually liked a lot. And the rest is beautiful.
mutual	The hobbit begins on a good note with the characters well placed.I having read the book could surely enjoy the aura that it initially creates.But the movie has not done justice to the way it ends.
positive	Don't believe the reviews. I was floored with how excellent this film is. After reading reviews, feared it would make me vomit in 3D, or be ridiculous and/or overly long.
mutual	The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey greatly lacks the authenticity of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy.
negative	I really tried to like the "new" 48fps  look of The Hobbit" and I was actually excited when I noticed the projector switched to HFR but all this self-motivation did not help.
mutual	As a multi-occasion reader of The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings series and with literally dozens of viewings of Jackson's initial masterpiece, I had been anticipating this one since the time when we were told del Toro would be directing.
negative	The high frame rate version absolutely looks horrible. The sound is awesome. The characters are great. So upset though, very disappointed. The motion looks like the characters were moving 1.
negative	The Hobbit is the novel that made me fall in love with literature when I was 10 years old. I read it every year for at least 15 years, and a few times since and it never fails to amuse and entertain me.
mutual	WARNING: SPOILERS
mutual	Director Peter Jackson, along with a tremendous amount of assistance from cinematographer Andrew Lesnie ("The Lord Of the Rings" trilogy) has again created a wonderful visual motion picture experience that is both amazingly expansive, yet lush and personable.
positive	If you watch this movie you will be enchanted by the adventures and a continue great work in every single detail. You will be absorbed by the magic of the middle earth, which's got an history before the Lord Of The Rings.
positive	The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, in my opinion, was a super film.
positive	Reluctantly a hobbit named Bilbo leaves the comfort of his own home to go on adventure with a band of dwarfs to reclaim their territory.
positive	Great movie. Very well done special effects and the 48 fps made the movie so very easy to watch in 3D. I am a guy who is anti-3D but it worked in this movie.
positive	Since there are already a thousand reviews for this, let me get right to the point. The first half of this movie is a bit silly and childish, but things get more serious and suspenseful in the second half as the movie begins to resemble the LOTR trilogy movies more.
positive	First of all,I respect the original Lord of the rings trilogy and love all the films.They were all very entertaining and epic especially watching them on the big screen(which I did see them in their extended cuts).
positive	The best way to start off a review of a movie, especially one like "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey" is to start off with this burning question that has been on everyone's m
positive	I too was worried when I heard that the Hobbit would be turned into a trilogy, but this introduction left me with no doubt that it would turn out for the best.
positive	After about 10 years, the return of Middle Earth on the big screen could have been a lot worse, yet it is not as good as the Lord of the Rings.
positive	Being a fan of the LOTR films and a self-confessed Tolkienite, I must admit I embarked upon my viewing of this film with a deal of trepidation lest it should ultimately disappoint.
positive	John Ronald Tolkien Also known as J.R.R. Tolkien has established himself as the foremost author of 'High Fantasy.
negative	Had to balance the scale, too much over-rated-ness, which is why I went with 1 star, and because: (1) Characters are gimmicky and NOT developed, think Jar Jar Binks.
mutual	I have to say I was very skeptical about this movie as a movie goer and a fan of the movies. I read the book a while back and I believe it followed it rather well.
mutual	After some 10 years since his grandeous Lord of the Rings trilogy, director Peter Jackson is ready to unleash his next great nerdgasm for the masses in form of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.
positive	The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey
positive	I am a massive fan of the Lord of the Rings. All 3 films are easily in my favourites list. When I heard Peter Jackson was to head the Hobbit, this was exciting news.
positive	When I first heard that Peter Jackson planned on adapting The Hobbit into 3 parts, I must say I was rather worried how they would turn out to be. Would it be dragging things too far?
mutual	The HFR (High Frame Rate) version of the Hobbit was simply terrible - it looked as if it had been shot with a cheap video-camera.
positive	I'll begin by saying this -- I love this genre, but I'm not a "fanboy." So this review is not completely unbiased, but I'll do my best. My main issue is how much I loved the Lord of the Rings trilogy (2001-2003).
positive	Just not what I thought its going to be its going be a three part movie and not a single long good complete movie what a shame just shows they are all about money and there go
positive	It seems Peter Jackson could not decide what kind of movie he was making. After leaving the theatre I'm not sure what I saw either. There was a Middle-Earth on screen, but there wasn't quite the same magic that I remember from ten years ago.
positive	For clarification, this review is based on the UK cinema release of The Hobbit in HFR 3D.
mutual	As we prepared for the return of PJ in tackling further adventures in Middle Earth, I think it's safe to say that it was unavoidable that this new trilogy would be weighed and measured against the masterpiece that is the LOTR.
negative	It's like the Star Wars prequels but less bad. The characters and the story are OK but for some reason the emphasis is put on **SpEcIaL!**EfFeCtS!**. As if we cared.
positive	I believe The Hobbit has the same soul and energy level the LOTR series maintained in fact at some point I even felt more excitement.
positive	I am a huge fan of "The Lord Of The Rings" series... I love those three movies of TLOTR.... So I was so much excited about "The Hobbit : An Unexpected Journey".
positive	The mysteries of middle earth are being murmured :p Precious Gollum is back on the screen :p Peter Jackson did not frustrate me at all.
positive	The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a fine return to form for director Peter Jackson. Guillermo del Toro, who's one of the writers for the film, was initially supposed to direct but he left the project in May of 2010.
positive	Actually, I've already written everything in the summary.
positive	I had not read any of the books or watched any of the films before so this was a voyage of discovery and at the end of the nearly three hours I was captivated by this film.
mutual	¨My dear Frodo, you asked me once if I had told you everything there was to know about my adventures. Well, I can honestly say I've told you the truth, I may not have told you all of it.¨
positive	The Hobbit tells the tale of a young(er) Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) who is dragged into a quest to reclaim the lost Dwarven kingdom of Erebor from the dragon Smaug, who has overthrown it.
positive	The Hobbit is one of the best movies this year and why? to answer that let's go into detail and start with what else but the beginning.
positive	The film is an excellent tribute to the original novel, it is a more mature version of it. While The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey does not reach the standards created by The Lord of the Rings trilogy, it fits quite well in the LOTR filmography and universe.
positive	Peter Jackson already proved himself to be the worthy director to shoot this film - The Lord Of The Rings trilogy was stunning and shot with care.
negative	I was waiting for something much more that i was getting. First of all i didn't know it was going to be another trilogy, so my expectations where higher than "first piece of trilogy" but still...
negative	The studio films these days are not looking to make great films like they used to, they are just going after customers money and making people waste 3 hours of their life's wh
positive	I did want to see this movie because it was one of those 'must see movies' that appear in the cinema from time to time (and some of those movies are actually good) but I was actually surprised as to how well this movie was done.
positive	"Lord of the Rings" in 2001-2003 brought to the creators 17 Oscars and the international recognition for Peter Jackson  until now he is called one of the best directors nowadays.
positive	The Hobbit had a lot to do, a prequel to the all conquering Lord of the Rings trilogy, a smaller book, aimed at a younger audience but it doesn't seem to have hampered the film.
negative	This is not 2001 anymore. Lot has been changed. Yet this movie remains the same. > In this movie no major villain die :( > In this movie nobody achieve nothing > And the worst part is when some one is about to die or slain, there comes help immediately bullshit.
positive	Peter Jackson is at it again pushing the limits of what the cinematic medium can do.He harnesses the power of 3D and marries it to his innovation of shooting at 48 frames per second.
positive	From a long awaited impatience, i went to see this film as soon as possible, and it did not disappoint.
positive	There is no chance that any commentators have as much Tolkien knowledge as I do, and besides for the fact that I cannot write well, I will freely admit as a hardcore fan of th
positive	I went to go see The Hobbit this evening with my mother and I was extremely pleased. As a 22 year old fan of the movie series, I was impressed with the way that the characters I remembered so well from the other films were handled.
positive	Brilliant film, enjoyed every minute of it. As a fan of the LOTRs trilogy it was great to revisit middle earth in all its glory. Excellent performances from Martin Freeman and Ian McKellen.
positive	If you liked The Lord of the Rings than you will fall right in love with The Hobbit. It is an incredible story that will make you wanting to ask for more.
mutual	There are lots of people rating this movie as the greatest thing ever, but really if you compare it to the original series you'd have to admit it falls far short.
positive	Having enjoyed the first three movies that Peter Jackson managed to shake out of his creative sleeve, then of course I had to watch the prequel as well.
negative	The entire movie is just... the party walking 10 feet, fight some orcs, party walking 10 feet, fight some golems, party walking 10 feet, fight some goblins, party walking 10 feet.. fight something else.
positive	Let me start by saying, I'm a huge fan of LoTR, I've red the book about a dozen of times starting from 1979 until a few years ago, and I didn't like Jackson's treatment of the story.
negative	It had good parts. I enjoyed Martin Freeman's performance in the earlier part of the movie, and the earlier part of the movie in general - because it did play to human interest, but this rapidly evaporated.
mutual	Overly long with nothing much happening for long periods. The pace of the film was pedantic at best and I found myself losing interest quite easily.
positive	I grew up to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and am a huge fan of the films as well as the books.
positive	A quiet and peaceful hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, having never known danger and adventure, is called to suddenly embark for an unexpected journey.
mutual	The two things that make "An Unexpected Journey" not that good as we all have hoped are its length and the inappropriate funny stuff Jackson mixes into it.
positive	I'm going to start by admitting, I'm not the biggest fan of fantasy, let alone The Lord of the Rings. I can see why people love them, they are well directed films and look magnificent.
positive	Let us look at the negative first.
negative	Lets keep it simple the thing is boring like hell.
negative	100% disappointing. How these guys managed to destroy a well written and interesting story? For me it is a mystery. Tolkien was a master of storytelling but you can hardly recognize his work in this farce.
negative	I loved this movie up to about the half way point. Then it fell apart big time. Actually painful to watch. (you sheep people should tell the truth).
negative	The Hobbit is a really good story, but what is it about a director who cannot even get the rhetoric of storytelling right, when the material is there already in the book. This is a real pity. Most of the story takes place on the road, but it felt more as if battles took up the bulk of it.
positive	Having read the Hobbit recently, it was easy for me to notice the little changes made to the story, some Tolkien fans will complain but not me!!
negative	First and foremost a movie should entertain. This one did not, it was boring beyond imagination. Making a 300 page book into 3 over-length movies without adding any new material simply can not work.
negative	A fantasy film produced to the highest possible standards. The music swells and toots with power, the cast offers charming and hilarious performances, and the set design, effects, costumes and props are all meticulously reproduced.
positive	Watching the Hobbit : unexpected journey was like a reunion. Saw the Hobbits village, their unique house, Frodo, Gandalf and.. Gollum. I can't believe I can still see them again, in a new story. for me LOTR series was ended in third movie. I remember how sad I am to see the story had finished.
mutual	Peter Jackson and company get an awful lot right here but the first part of his epic 'Hobbit' adaptation is largely an overblown mess. The flaws of his 'Rings' adaptations are ultra prevalent here. What we get here is an over complicated and thematically schizophrenic mess.
positive	I do admit, I had high expectations for this movie. I just finished the book as it released. I loved the mythology in this movie. I loved the action sequences and the visual experience.
mutual	Pros: Good music, many beautiful visuals and details, good casting, good acting when the CG is toned down (Gandalf and Galadriel; Bilbo and Gollum etc.), fun variety of locales and monsters.
negative	P Jackson totally missed the flavor of the book. I understand trying to make a movie that meshed with LOTR movies but it very loosely followed the book.
positive	I took my son to see this as a Christmas treat for him. And discovered three things about the Hobbit I did not know before:
positive	I went into this movie having read the book and pretty much knowing what to expect, after reading many reviews of all kinds.
positive	I never thought anyone could turn a book like The Hobbit into 3 movies, but Peter Jackson has in his interpretation of Tolkien's classic. People expecting a replica of the book will be disappointed.
negative	As many people have written long reviews, I will make mine short and to the point.
positive	Let me start off by saying that I'm a huge fan of the Lord of the Rings films and novels. In fact, they are my favorite films of all time and I watched the trilogy at least 5 times since last year!
positive	I was so desperate to see this movie! So, so excited and I was ready to argue with everyone who didn't like it, but...how awful I felt when I saw it! I mean, what happened? What went wrong?
mutual	The obvious has already been stated by almost everyone  The book is simply too slim to support a 9 hour movie trilogy and what's more it isn't serious or even "epic" enough to sustain such a treatment.
mutual	We went along to the cinema having been given tickets by someone who couldn't go. Turned out we were going to see the 3D version filmed in 48 frames per second (fps).
mutual	People will always compare it with the LOTR trilogy, consciously or otherwise. And that is the biggest challenge facing the Hobbit trilogy. After watching it my first comment was, it should have been made before the LOTR trilogy.
mutual	Years ago, when it was announced that Guillermo Del Toro would direct the prequel to the Lord of the Rings and that Tolkien's classic would be turned into two movies, people were skeptical that it could be done.
mutual	I was afraid this would happen after the 48 fps issue was so hyped. Just like Star Wars prequels, this movie does not try to be good. It tries to maximize profit at the expense of quality.
negative	A few days ago I saw this movie and I hated it. About half way through I was planning on just walking out, but I felt self-conscious because I was near the front of the audience, so I waited for a darker scene, but it never came.
mutual	I was actually fairly disappointed in 'An Unexpected Journey' if I'm honest, I am a major fan of the lord of the rings books and the films, in fact the collectors edition, directors cut LOTR films may be the best films out there, however I can not say that The Hobbit will be joining them.
positive	Long before he took the helm of "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy, New Zealand born Peter Jackson had acquired both a name and a reputation for himself as an independent splatter-gore horror movie maestro.
negative	This film wasn't made for the LOTR fans; it was made for those who were born after the LOTR was made.
negative	Peter Jackson has done it again. He has created an all-encompassing epic saga of Tolkien's Hobbit book, and after coming away from the first chapter, how does this rate not only as a film on its own, but as a part of the whole?
mutual	It's been nine years since we last saw Peter Jackson's tackle Tolkien's fantastical world on the big screen, but now the New Zealand filmmaker returns with The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.
positive	Hello there, its my 1st review. OK here we go. This movie is AWESOME i was waiting for it the whole year. It is almost as it is in a book (I read the book around 1000 times).
positive	"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey" takes us back to middle earth and this trip back is even better than what I remember of it.
positive	I really don't understand all the hate that seems to surround this movie.The Hobbit: Is an amazing movie! It's a great movie for the whole family.
positive	Ugh, there is just so much about Peter Jackson's return to Middle Earth that I wish had gone better. My expectations were high for the first HOBBIT movie, but I did my best to keep them in check.
positive	I never came around to read the LotR books before watching the movies and I actually haven't done that until now (so maybe shame on me), but I did read 30-40 pages of the Hobbit.
positive	Its not as bad as some say, but its not as good as the LOTR films were.
positive	People say that this movie is not connected to The Lord of the Rings, and if you review it from that angle, not from LOTR perspective, this is one really good movie!
positive	The Lord of the Rings trilogy is one of the most outstanding achievements in filmmaking history. They have a great story, great characters, great effects and just a great feel to them.
positive	I'm one of the biggest Lord of the Rings fans imaginable, actually I spent my entire youth in Middle Earth and some part of me is probably still there.
positive	Special effects are getting better and The Hobbit captures a bit of the magic from the Lord of the Rings trilogy from a decade ago. 10 years of CGI advancement show a noticeable improvement.
positive	After reading some of the bogus reviews regarding The Hobbit an expected Journey, I've decided to open up an account with IMDb to set the story straight.
positive	After The Lord of the Rings (best trilogy ever made), in which each film was truly a masterpiece, rumors emerged years later saying that Peter Jackson would make the movie "The Hobbit" inspired by the work of Tolkien, which tells the story before the events of Lord of the Rings, Mr.
positive	Well from the reviews I have read so far, I might be going against the grain here but I have actually voted this film higher than I did the LOTR trilogy.
positive	I first seen The Hobbit at the cinema in December and thought that it was a good and entertaining film. It was not until I bought the blu-ray release I realized that it's a great film.
positive	It's not Lord of the Rings and some people who I knew were disappointed with this film's juvenile humour obviously have either not read the book or understood that Tolkien wrote The Hobbit as a children's story.
positive	"My dear Frodo, you asked me once if I had told you everything there was to know about my adventures. Well, I can honestly say I've told you the truth, I may not have told you all of it.
positive	The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a 2012 film directed by Peter Jackson, starring Martin Freeman and Ian McKellen.
positive	Doesn't have as much substance compared to "Fellowship of the Ring" but still a pretty solid movie. But "Lord of the Rings" has 3 separate novels that make up the trilogy and three separate movies.
mutual	The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is an adventure film with fantastic elements in it. If you liked the fantasy of Lord of the Rings, then you are surely going to love the fantastic elements of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.
positive	Just wanted to say to everybody who thinks they have "milked" the story ore added things that do not exist in the original book. Yes there at lots of things in the movie which you can't read in the book "the hobbit"
positive	Peter Jackson's long awaited adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved fantasy novel is finally here, nearly a decade after the last installment in Jackson's magnificent Lord of the Rings trilogy was released to cinemas in 2003.
negative	***SPOILERS***
positive	Peter Jackson's Awesome a director who knows how to edit a story and make the best of it, This movie on 3D is just awesome shooting and projection at frame rate of 48 fps makes it a first film, looks blurry at some scenes though.
mutual	I first became excited about this film having watched a few of The Hobbit's many lengthy pre-release production videos. In them the thirteen dwarfs were all laughing, having fun, and exuded an aura of infectious personality that had them poised to carry the film.
positive	The Hobbit is considered by many to be the finest work of fantasy ever written. Worldwide, somewhere between 35 and 100 million copies of The Hobbit have been sold since it was published in 1937.
positive	When I first heard the reviews from the 'experts' I was a little disheartened to say the least, but the truth is I shouldn't have been worried.
positive	The Hobbit is a prequel to lord of the rings. A young Hobbit (Bilbo Baggins), has a unexpected guest come over to invite for an adventure. (Gandolf) Bilbo kicks him out.
positive	The Hobbit is actually quite hard to review. With the hype (and outrage) surrounding the 48fps HFR filming, it was always going to polarise opinions. For my viewing, I chose the trusted 24fps 2D viewing, and my review reflects this version alone.
positive	Let's first just say that all of the haters of this film will always be haters, so i will not even bother trying to convince them, that this movie is good.
negative	I really struggled with what to rate this movie. I was such a fan of the Cartoon Version that I couldn't wait for this to come out! I'm so totally disappointed!!
mutual	In all honesty, I was disappointed by The Hobbit. The film didn't leave me with quite the same satisfied feeling as the Lord of the Rings did. Since then I've been thinking of the reasons for this... here are issues with The Hobbit:
negative	At the age of 12, I read the first book of this trilogy of J. R. R. Tolkien. I lent the books at the school-library, and somehow i still got them (17 years later).
positive	Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, orcs and hobbits, dwarfs, elves and trolls of all ages.
positive	I liked "The Hobbit" it was a great children's novel that served its purpose, and it was wildly effective at getting its points across.
positive	Even though the movie is not totally based on the book, the lord of the ring's fans won't be disappointed. The special effects and the music are magical and the performance of the actors great.
mutual	Let me get things straight first. I enjoyed "An Expected Journey" as I was viewing it. From the film's first half hour, I could tell that it wasn't going to be an event as grand and glorious as any of the "Lord of the Rings" movies, which was just fine by me.
mutual	I am a fan of the Lord of The Rings Trilogy, they're truly magnificent and convey a almost real-life feel that reading the books gives you. However, the Hobbit failed to match up to the trilogy.
negative	After Peter Jackson had made the Lord of the Rings in such a magnificent way, following the the plot of the books very satisfyingly, I was really looking forward to go see the Hobbit.
positive	I am a fan of the Lord of the Rings series and I had high expectations for this movie, it didn't quite reach those expectations but was still pretty good.
positive	As if the Lord of the rings series couldn't get any better, Peter Jackson manages once again to deliver s stunning masterpiece. The scenery chosen was perfect and went hand in hand with the book's tone.
positive	The heart that carries this movie is much more than the extension to the RINGS saga it may seem. The depth of landscape is on such a grand scale that it dwarfs (no pun intended) any other epic.
positive	well I'm going to keep this very short , iv been waiting for this since the announcement of the hobbit and after my excitement of watching it i can confirm i was not disappoin
positive	*CONTAINS SPOILERS*
positive	The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the golden ticket that takes us back to Middle Earth where we can once again immerse ourselves in this deep, intricate and magical world.
positive	MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!
positive	I'm waiting for the next episode of this Soap Opera, because that's what it looks like in HFR. Skip that terrible miscarriage of video technology. Don't need the realism. Don't want the realism. It's freaking Middle Earth, for crying out loud, I don't want to see the glue in Gandalf's wig.
positive	After hearing so many, well, negative reviews I had almost decided not to check The Hobbit out in the cinemas. Fortunately a few well trusted reviewers said that it was actually pretty awesome.
mutual	Peter Jackson's The Hobbit has hit cinemas with a hype collected by his previous The Lord Of The Rings trilogy.
mutual	I've been waiting for The Hobbit ever since the LOTR trilogy. Didn't expect the same type of film, as it's source is a children's book after all, but I did expect to be entertained and enjoy great Middle-earth visuals.
positive	Movie Critics don't deserve to watch movies based on JRR Tolkien's literature. They are ignorant movie goers and don't understand the subtleties of the Tolkien universe.
positive	Bilbo the Hobbit is a film that just came to cinemas, and has been rated as an excellent movie. Strangely enough, some people rated it as a less good film than the Lord of the Rings.
positive	As a standalone movie The Hobbit is a good movie thats why i gave it a 7 but when compared to the LOTR movies it sucks the visuals are fake looking the big orcs and wolves are like cartoons and i watched it in 2D.
mutual	Well. That was certainly... something.
positive	I'll get this out of the way first: as a faithful adaption of the book, this fails. It misses the spirit of the printed Hobbit, attempting to graft on too many "epic this!
positive	Peter Jackson created something so reminiscent of LOTR that is looks like he is lacking new ideas. Many shots, scenes and even lines were almost copy-pasted.
positive	Expectations were high as I sat through the many advertisements to finally see the movie was about to start. Despite the many reviews that took made it out to sound that Jackson had lost his touch, I refused to believe that they were true and went to see for myself. And I am very glad that I did.
positive	'The Hobbit' is a novel written by J.R.R. Tolkien, consisting of less than 300 pages - significantly smaller in size than the three Lord of the Rings books.
positive	The Hobbit is a masterpiece and is well based on the excellent book 'The Hobbit' by J. R. Tolkien. The movie takes you on a journey of a lifetime and takes you inside the imaginary mind of Peter Jackson.
positive	It's been a long journey to the beginning, but here we are, finally.
mutual	I had high hopes for this movie after enjoying the Lord of the Ring, but The Hobbit proved to be a tremendous disappointment after its predecessor set the bar so high.
mutual	... if only it had not tried to blow a wonderful, short and sweet children's book up into an LOTR-style epic.
negative	We already have a long drawn out trilogy in Lord of the Rings and don't need another. The Hobbit should be a one off, one crack at it, one shot deal. Its to much, to long, to drawn out.
negative	After hesitating for a while between Django Unchained and the Hobbit, my wife and I chose to watch the latter. I read many bad reviews but some people also suggested that it was still worth seeing.
positive	I saw the digital HFR 3D version, not sure what to expect. I liked "Avatar", but there were times when the 3D in that movie was simply distracting, and to be honest I can't even recall now what it looked like, which goes to show how much of an impact it made on me.
positive	Just my 2 cents. I was afraid to go see this. I reread the book in prep. Peter Jackson did a great job filling in the gaps and matching the tone of LOTR movies.
positive	You've likely heard of the surprising critical reaction to Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings prequel, The Hobbit.
positive	A new movie about from the hand of Peter Jackson about the Hobbits, what a pleasure to see.
positive	Many critics have stated that 'The Hobbit' is a disappointing film and that they were expecting to see something similar to 'Lord of the Rings' but they didn't.
positive	Why is this being hated upon so badly? I am a die-hard Lord of the Rings movie fan (and the Hobbit was the only book I read of Tolkeins LOTR novels!
positive	Tolkien's bed time story is revamped in a more epic fashion with Peter Jacksons return to the stunning world of Middle Earth in The Hobbit, a tale of a secluded, comfort lovin
positive	I found myself reading a number of mixed reviews from a vast array of critics this morning, trying to make some sense of what they were saying.
positive	There is two things you can't help yourself falling in love with, this type of tales, and peter jackson bring it up to the screen ..
positive	Having read the book a few times I was quite excited. Having seen the film I was disappointed. The film at times is just incredible, when it follows Tolkien's lead, and disappointing when it strayed from the book, namely for action scenes. 8/10 is an incredible mark, but I expected more.
positive	The Hobbit I is a very good movie. All the characters are well played, the story and the attention to details are amazing, as are the effects, the costumes, the music - in sho
negative	Despite being a big fan of Peter Jackson's earlier work, this time I must admit that the story did not captivated me as I expected and leaves much to be desired.
positive	I just saw The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey and it was very disappointing. When I heard they were going to make 2(3) movies out of a very short book I expected them to use a lot of the backstory from The Appendices, The Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales.
positive	The Lord of the Rings trilogy is an impossible standard of a trilogy. The Hobbit is an entertaining, heartwarming, and humorous film that nobody will recognize that views it with a critical eye.
positive	Similar to The FOTR, the Hobbit begins with a flashback to give the viewer a connection with Thorin and the other dwarfs as the great dragon Smaug takes over Erabor and the gold.
positive	I know by having such a title for a review will probably earn me the hate of many people. I have always felt that J.R.R. Tolkien was a bit of a paradox.
positive	First of all don't judge the film itself positively or negatively strictly due to the OPTION of seeing it in 48 fps. Now the beginning of the film is slow and at times doesn't even feel like LOTR due to the lack of familiar faces.
positive	Key questions come to mind for those who have yet to see this movie. One is: is it as good as the Lord of the Rings films? While I personally believe it is not, that is beyond the point.
positive	Initially a little crestfallen and rather sceptical after reading the numerous negative reviews, I left the theatre wanting to immediately have another viewing of this amazing film.
positive	No spoilers here.
positive	The Hobbit may not be as good as the Lord of the Rings trilogy but then that is because it is inherently a weaker story. I would like to address certain criticisms I have often read:
positive	I'll make short word of this. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a truly brilliant film. This is not a 'biased' review by some kiwi who wants the film to be great just because it was made here.
positive	Finally Peter Jackson graces us with the prequel to the best film trilogy (The Lord of the Rings) with "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey".
positive	As the end credits rolled over the screen I was left a wrack. The last few minutes of this film take you on an emotional roller coaster I can promise you that! And the greatest thing about it, is how much fantastic stuff it promises for the next ones.
positive	This movie is sillier than it's older brother, something you could predict from the pictures of the shaved and silly looking dwarfs.
positive	First things first. I grew up with the literary works of Jrr Tolkien and The Lord of the Rings-trilogy by Peter Jackson is my all time favorite movies and that he was returning to Middle-Earth for an adaptation of The Hobbit which is my favorite of the Tolkien-books I got excited as hell.
negative	My wife and I are both Tolkien fans and met 10 years ago during our third visit to LOTR part 1. We both read The Hobbit, The LOTR and The Silmarillion.
positive	I've read a lot of the bad and good reviews here and I must say that most of them are written without even reading the book. If you've read the book, you could see that it is a child book.
positive	This is a review, written right after having seen the movie, the Hobbit.
positive	This is the first movie I've seen in the cinema for a long time.
mutual	As a Tolkien fanboy, I knew that this wasn't probably going to meet my fanboy expectation. I think Jackson doing it tried to hold true to what the book was, but had to succumb o entertainment value.
positive	I have one word to describe this movie... WOW! The story is not what I remember from the only time I read the book, but Hollywood being Hollywood, I am OK with the creative license for this movie.
positive	The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey
positive	The short: 48fps. Looks just like Lord of the Rings. Is NOT Lord of the Rings.
positive	As a dedicated fan of the Lord of the Rings series and all of Tolkien's work put into it, this was ultimately a must see film for myself.
positive	i went to the movie with my boyfriend (who by the way isn't a big fan of adventure movies) and we enjoyed this movie so much.
mutual	Review: What an epic movie! I was lucky that I had something to do, because I definitely would have fallen asleep whilst watching the film.
positive	Having watched the original Lord of the Rings Trilogy and being a massive fan, I expected huge things from The Hobbit and needless to say, it provided.
positive	The Hobbit: An Unexcepted Journey begins back in the Shire 60 years earlier as Bilbo Baggins takes his long journey to the Lonely Mountain with Gandalf, Thorin Oakenshield, and the thirteen dwarfs Bifur, Bombur, Fili, Kili, Nori, Ori, Dori, Gloin, Dwalin, Balin.
positive	It amazes me how the generations get so Jaded. The BIG debates over this film are whether it's too much of a kid's movie and if the the CG is overwrought.
positive	The one thing I'm disappointed about, is the lack of appreciation and recognition of effort that went into this movie FROM the critics. No matter what they say, this movie is brilliant and amazing.
positive	Why the grasp at cheap laughs? I mean, 'Ori: Have they got any chips?' Absolutely ruined that scene. Just, well, a stupid throw away line that just didn't need to be in the film.
positive	Sat at the cinema with no intervals (the movie started late) my bum was extremely numb by the end, but who cares because this film was well worth it.
positive	The Hobbit an Unexpected Journey good movie as lord of the ring This film has nothing to do with lord of the ring, just some character are same but story totally different.
positive	Peter Jackson's first entry in the eagerly awaited Hobbit trilogy was one of the most hyped films of 2012.
mutual	The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a three hour 12a/PG-13 Rated Movie based on Part 1 of the classic novel. I had never seen a Lord of The Rings movie before, so I went in very much with an open mind.
mutual	The Lord of the Rings trilogy is undoubtedly my favourite trilogy of all time. The films were based on three books though and felt very natural even if the films ignored some story-lines in the books and expanded others.
positive	Nothing in this review is a spoiler if you have already seen the Lord of Rings (LOTR) trilogy (or read the book)!!!
positive	Tolkien fans will know the story well. Many years before Frodo travels to Mordor in Lord of the Rings, Bilbo Baggins embarks on an adventure of his own.
positive	First off, I'm a big fan of the LOTR series and had high expectations for the prequel.
positive	There were some real positive aspects about the hobbit, BUT nothing we have not already seen before. You can't go into this movie with a lot of high expectations, and it is impossible to discuss this film without pointing out scenes that are full of spoilers.
mutual	Let me start by saying what a huge fan I am of LOTR, so of course was so excited that the hobbit was being made!
positive	When I heard that they were making a trilogy out of The Hobbit, I groaned. I expected a slow, boring, movie that would murder the book, despite it being from the producer who did The Lord of the Rings so tastefully.
positive	I want to start off by saying that I am a Tolkien purist. I have read the Silmarillion. I have read The Hobbit twice. I have read all three books of The Lord of the Rings thrice.
positive	The first return people were expressing was that "it isn't anywhere near as the Lord of the Rings". This is a logical conclusion, to some extent, seeing as Jackson is once again present in the party (thank God) and seeing how The Hobbit is the prequel of the Ring movies.
positive	Not quite the same bawling my eyes out epicness of the first three, but this was a good movie.
positive	I watched The Hobbit: An unexpected journey (2012) and I am confused that the movie is better than LOTR or not, after some time I realized The Hobbit is a different kind of movie as we comparing to LOTR, because it kind of serious type movie and a good one we all know about it.
positive	The movie is amazing. It is unlike anything I've ever experienced in a cinema. The vividness of the colors and light and movement is something to behold.
positive	Peter Jackson's "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," may be the most captivating adventure movie of 2012. Based on the novel by J.R.
positive	The first installment of J R R Tolkien's The Hobbit novel is extraordinary. I haven't watched the LOTR trilogy but have heard a lot. Nor have I read any of those books. But after watching I am gonna read those including The Silmarillion.
positive	First of all this is not a kids movie! I know it is based on a children's book but this movie was kind of mature. {spoilers}When Thorins father got killed in the war by orcs the took his head of and showed it to the audience.
negative	Welp, I guess as a movie, the Hobbit was okay. If you're a fan of the LOTR flicks then you'll enjoy this film. If you haven't read the book, you might possibly enjoy it.
positive	I liked the LOTR films but I wouldn't say I was a fan. I've only watched the first and the third entry more than once and haven't read any of the books or even spent any time trying to learn more about the characters or the world it takes place in.
positive	I went into this film with too much expectation, and a strange sense of nervousness. My first and only viewing so far was in 2D, my preferred viewing dimension for movies, and needless to say I was not disappointed.
negative	This movie should be renamed The Hobbit: Unexpected Cruelty. Of course, the directors hid the extreme cruelty found to animals in the making. These include :
positive	To be honest, after all the bad things I'd heard said about Unexpected Journey from other LOTR fans, I went in expecting a mess. But, even though I'm a die-hard LOTR fan, I loved this film.
positive	Directed by Peter Jackson. Starring Martin Freeman, Ian McKellen and Richard Armitage. Written by: Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, Peter Jackson, Guillermo del Toro and J.R.R Tolkien.
positive	Another showing of the quest, but this one precedes the restoration journeys of The Ring.
positive	One of the best adventure movies I've ever seen. The movie about the young Hobbit -Bilbo Baggins - who lived in Shire a place in J. R. R. Tolkien books-, he helped to the Dwarfs to recapture their mountain from dragon.
negative	This movie was lousy. How in the world do people think this is worthy of an 8.3? First of all, who shot this movie? This movie looks like it was shot with a hand-held video camera that was bought used at a local pawnshop.
mutual	As a massive fan of the Lord of the Rings trilogy and the works of Tolkein, I had high expectations for The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. However, I was not prepared for what I saw.
positive	The Hobbit from Peter Jackson was a landmark in his career, after working in film for 25 years. (Starting with Bad Taste in 1987.) Now we have hit 2013, it has now been just about over 25 years since our New Zealand friend has been directing.
positive	Loving the books and LOTR films Peter Jackson made, the Hobbit was a big disappointment.
positive	The Hobbit is a fantastic movie with an amazing storyline,great cast,terrific characters and some great action and humor,bringing us some more very impressive work from Peter Jackson.
positive	I just saw Hobbit in HFR 3D. The movie was very good, but not spectacular. I'd give it 4 stars. My complaint is - as expected - they added too much filler to make what should be 2 normal length movies into 3 long ones.
positive	There were many things that made me dubious about this film. Firstly, the decision to split a modest novel over three films seemed silly.
mutual	I went to see the hobbit with mixed expectations. The trailer for this movie had gotten me really excited but I knew, that if I expected to see another masterpiece like the Lord of The Rings Trilogy I would probably be disappointed.
negative	Pretty sets - Bilbo's house is brilliant, and who would not want to live there? The biggest problem with this is it is way too long. The joy of the book is that it is a perfectly self contained adventure.
positive	This is a good movie; no, this is a great movie. Quite simply, it is better than any of the LOTRs movies. The reason for this is Bilbo Baggins.
positive	Having never read the book, I didn't know what to expect next. Having read so many reviews, I did't either. Lot's of reviews were down right negative, calling the movie boring and long. Others called it a masterpiece. After being exhausted leaving the theatre, I lean towards the latter.
positive	I had first seen the Hobbit in regular 3D and thought that despite having many flaws, it was a subjugating success. And I really thought critics got it wrong.
positive	'The Lord Of The Rings' is regarded as one of the greatest fantasy tales in all of literary history and when Peter Jackson decided to convert these great books to movies it worked flawlessly and was executed with great finesse.
positive	As a huge LOTR trilogy fan, I set the bar on this movie pretty high to begin with, but it just didn't come close to where anyone should expect.
positive	Fun and enjoyable film for the whole family. This was like visiting with a child hood friend whom you haven't seen for years. Peter Jackson once again brings the Tolkien classic alive and I found myself wishing the credits would never come.
positive	Peter Jackson continues to balance a faithful adaptation of a revered book with the realities of the movie format. The almost 3 hours fly by quickly and it almost feels like the movie needed a slower pace, but I suppose it has to first and foremost "entertain".
positive	This movie has gotten mixed reviews before I saw the movie and I was worried if this movie will ruin the reputation of the LOTR franchise, then I saw this movie with a friend and I ended up liking the movie, actually Loving it.
positive	The Lord of the Rings were on equal scale as Harry Potter. However, If you've missed the first Harry Potter you aren't as quite enthusiastic to continue to watch the remaining series.
positive	This movie has already gotten an extreme amount of negativity towards it and many complaining about this new 48 FPS. Well, guess what? I saw it in 24 FPS with no 3D and it was so, so worth it.
positive	I watched the film in both 2D format and 3D HFR format. I enjoyed the 2D version of the film. However, I enjoyed the 3D HFR version even better.
positive	I have read the book and was expecting a very similar experience and storyline as the book was however they seemed to have taken it another direction.
positive	So it's here, Peter Jackson's very highly anticipated return to Middle- Earth has arrived. Despite nearly entering development hell, with directors duties changing hands before Peter Jackson finally decided to just take it on himself.
negative	The entire LotR series was done in three movies, and they couldn't finish the Hobbit in one? This slow paced clunker failed to amaze most of the people in my family, and focused too much on visuals rather than action, dialogue, plot, or character development. CGI alone does not a movie make.
negative	What a disappointment! The scenes were much too drawn out and long. Especially the opening scene with the dinner. That was only good for a nap. There were humorous elements and most were childish which didn't give the movie a serious feeling (overall).
positive	I entered the screening of this film with anticipation but underlying tones of dread. After hearing so many negative things about The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, I was sceptical as to whether I'd like it - let alone enjoy it.
positive	(reviewed from a 24 fps 2D screening) Some things are pretty indisputable about the Hobbit: the story has been stretched (for the sake of Commerce) to the point of breaking and for a pretty lean novel, it feels bloated and tangential.
positive	The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is very impressive in terms of storytelling, action, VFX, cinematography and many more. It's a great film.
positive	One of the great literary works of the 20th century  largely considered the forerunner of the entire fantasy genre  received its first live action screen adaptation this past week. And like most adaptations, it delighted some and left other die-hard purists disappointed.
positive	I am a huge fan of Tolkien, particularly his Lord of the Rings series, and thought that the three movies made in the early 2000's were amazing. I went to the Hobbit expecting to be a little less amazed, I have never been MORE wrong.
positive	'The Hobbit' is impressive. Very impressive. This may be because I first read a somewhat negative comment, before watching the movie actually.
positive	What a journey it has been It is a great film no doubt, took me back to my early days when I first watched Lord of the Rings with my father though he was not here with me today sadly.
positive	Okay, so I'm probably going out on a limb here, but lets just pray some giant eagles will catch me if I fall.
negative	Ever since seeing the LOTR trilogy and then reading the books (eight times), I've been excited about The Hobbit. I walked into the theater expecting another show of excellence by Peter Jackson. What I got was a childish and poorly done adaption of an excellent story.
positive	Having seen both the 3D and HFR-3D versions of the Hobbit, I can tell you that the HFR is much more fun.
positive	(Update: As promised I watched 2D as well and now gave 10/10)
positive	I find it very hard to review this title because I'm a Tolkien fanatic and one of those people who would kill to be in Peter Jackson's Middleearth.
positive	If you liked The Lord of the Rings movies than you'll like this film. The visuals are absolutely incredible and it has that familiar LOTR feel that we all know and love.
positive	I am a fan of J.K. Rowling and her creation, Harry Potter. Nevertheless, despite the marvelous display of imaginary of Rowling, it cannot be compared, not even slightly, to the works of J.
positive	It was a really well made movie.
positive	I really enjoyed the Hobbit. I suspect part of my enjoyment came from entering without certain delusions. The Hobbit is a children's story, I was six or seven when I first read it whereas the Lord of the Rings, is not.
positive	I was much anticipated to see this film with high expectations after seeing the trilogy from Peter Jackson and loved the original work from Tolkien himself when I read the trilogy and the prequel.
positive	First off, I must tell you all that I am a normal guy.. not some movie critic who knows all about directing or anything on the technical side but listen here.. Don't be fooled by the critics!
positive	It is not very often that a film's title encapsulates all it stands for. We truly are taken on an unexpected journey of wonder, and the most sensational fantasy ride the world of cinema has to offer.
positive	Sequel films are really intriguing for me and this was one of them. Especially after watching three LOTR movies it felt like amazing going into the very beginning after a long time.
positive	A mild-mannered Hobbit by the name of Bilbo Baggins is tasked with joining a group of Dwarfs, lead by Gandalf, to the Lonely Mountain in the hopes of claiming their home and gold back from the dragon Smaug.
positive	First off, I'd like to begin the review by saying that I've watched it in 24 fps without 3D, and I'm VERY happy I had decided so. I had read beforehand horrible, horrible things about 48 fps, and 3D just isn't my style.
positive	The Hobbit exceeds every expectation that I had. Being a fan of both the novels and movies, I did set the bar high for this movie because...
positive	Just saw the movie yesterday in 3D and i think it was AMAZING, me and my brother set for the full 170 min and the only thing that i was sorry about was the 5 minute break that interrupted the flow of the movie.
positive	I don't really know why so many people hate this movie. Here is the real deal with the Hobbit.
positive	' I'm going on an adventure ' Bilbo Baggins excitedly said as he left his home of bag-end as he began his adventure of a life-time.
positive	I thought this film was amazing, I'm going to see it again. I absolutely loved it. Martin Freeman was amazing as Bilbo Baggins and actually topped Sam as my favorite hobbit.
positive	As a huge LOTR fan I was really looking forward to the Hobbit. My childhood memories came all back when I saw the first trailer, I was a kid again. I really loved the book of the Hobbit and couldn't believe that they were making this film.
positive	Too tired to make a thorough review right now as I just watched the premiere. But I will say this movie was excellent. The fantasy and story of it drew me deep within the realm of the Lord of the Rings, which I hadn't visited in years.
positive	You know what gets my goat? People who complain that a movie doesn't match the book. First of all, you realize that when reading a book, your IMAGINATION is the theatre screen.
positive	The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is here at last and it's worth its wait in gold, ten times over! It is unquestionably one of the greatest cinematic experiences ever, and a proud prequel to the equally consummate The Lord of the Rings trilogy.
positive	Still remember walking out of the first LOTR movie feeling a little disappointed although knowing 'movie' retelling needs to appeal to a wider audience, I can say I was not disappointed in the first Hobbit movie, a book I have read more than 20 times.
positive	The Hobbit is well-paced, starts with more of a back-story and introduction of the main characters before exploding with an action-packed second half. I can't remember all the little details from the book but the arc of the movie follows the book closely, which in my opinion is good.
positive	Once again the idiotic critics and members of the public who think they are great by putting down big blockbuster movies are so far out with their judgement of this film. If you do not like fantasy adventure films then don't judge it, your opinion is meaningless.
positive	I am a longtime Tolkien fan who likely read most of his works before most of the posters here were born. Peter Jackson did an absolutely superb job bringing LOTR to the screen, due in large part to sticking very closely to Tolkien's work.
positive	The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the first part of the movie adaption of J.R.R. Tolkiens "The Hobbit". It was written years before "The Lord of the Rings" and intended for a younger audience.
positive	One of the main problems of the "star wars" latest trilogy was the difference in time between chapter VI and chapter I. The filmmaking was so different that it was hard getting into that universe again.
positive	"The Hobbit An Unexpected Journey" is a surprisingly good film. Ian McKellen is great as reprising his role, "Gandalf the Grey".
positive	If you are one of those people who are looking for another Lord of the Rings you will not find that in this movie. While it shares many of the same elements that the Lord of the Rings movies had it differs from it through tone.
positive	There were worries the film might be too long, there were worries that it shouldn't have been split into three parts and then there were people who thought it may have been too light hearted to be taken seriously.
positive	This film really kicked off the whole winter season. Jackson really brought in a lot of bells and whistles, but they were all there to warm the heart and make you smile at the screen.
positive	One of the best films I've seen in a very long time.
mutual	I want to start by saying that it is a good movie. It's funny, full of adventure. But if you are, like I am, a fan of Tolkien, and that you expect to see The hobbit, you might be as disappointed as I am.
positive	I have been foaming at the mouth, waiting very impatiently for the release of this movie. Like most here, I am an avid Tolkien fan. It's hard to sometimes separate the fiction from fact when I feel like I know these characters as well as I know myself.
positive	The Hobbit is being slated in many reviews for being excessively long and convoluted, due to Jackson's over-indulgence and the addition of too many subplots that turn a simple children's story into a fantasy epic along the lines of Tolkein's other great masterpiece.
positive	The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the first part of Peter Jackson's planned trilogy based on J.R.R Tolkien's precursor to The Lord of the RIngs, The Hobbit.
positive	After I read up all the critical rubbish about the movie I can tell you - I was afraid they might have messed up big time.
positive	First of all, The Hobbit, as we all know, is a prequel to the LOTR. So technically, there would be nothing different. How can it be any different?.
positive	As a big Tolkien fan, and a huge admirer of Peter Jackson's triumph with the LOTR series, I was somewhat nervous before this film, hoping and wishing it would live up to it's expectations, proving wrong the critics who rather uselessly claimed it "plodding", "overblown" and "eye straining."
positive	I was so incredibly pleased with The Hobbit!! I was completely entranced and delighted the entire movie, I couldn't stop smiling my head off 'cause I was so happy! It was awesome! Seriously, after seeing this, I'm still giddy the next morning with delight at how good it was!
positive	I'm an old man and ain't got time left in this life to write a lot. Took three of my sons to see the midnight showing of this movie (IMAX and 3D), paid big bucks to do so, and expected a lot.
positive	It's been an Age or two since I saw a Tolkien film for the first time -- I was last about ten or so. I never had the pleasure of seeing the Ring trilogy in theater's, much less at a midnight premier, but tonight was going to be full of unexpected pleasures anyhow.
positive	Many reviews from the professional or amateur film critics have already gone over the story and mechanics. Wanted to write a general overview of the entertainment value and if the 3D is worth viewing.
positive	The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is by far a film masterpiece. With stunning 3D images and beautiful landscape shots this film certainly deserves an Oscar for Best Visual Effects.
positive	The Hobbit seemed like it would be a difficult book to make into a movie. In one way, it is a silly children's book with some silly characters.
positive	Like all good stories there is always a beginning, middle and end. An Unexpected Journey sets the ground work for the next two installments just as the Fellowship did for LOTR.
positive	After 9 years from the LOTR, the prequel had left me thinking what will Peter Jackson do with Hobbit, after all the controversies and legal issues the movie went through (the delays), I had hoped this movie to release soon.
negative	I liked the Hobbit AUJ but didn't enjoy it much (i'll come to why in a bit), I'm not a big fan of 3D, it confuses me & causes me strain.
positive	This film "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey" is an exciting and visual start for a new trilogy that is a prequel to "The Lord of the Rings" movies. Based on J. R. R.
positive	The Hobbit is an extraordinary movie and deserves a lot more than it is getting. For some reason critics are giving the movie "average" reviews which doesn't make sense.
positive	When I heard that the Hobbit was in production, I was beside myself with joy. I had never read the book, and most people I knew hadn't either. Until I had seen the movie, I had no idea that the role 'The Hobbit', and Bilbo Baggins played was so huge in shaping the events of the LotR trilogy.
positive	It was absolutely amazing, great graphics, quite funny where allowed, fast paced action, awesome character development (of old and new characters), a movie the whole family can enjoy, very well done!
positive	The film was just excellent, from beginning to very end I was submersed in what was truly an epic adventure, cannot wait to see the next installments now.
positive	After many months of waiting and expectation, I was finally able to see 'The Hobbit: an Unexpected Journey' in its midnight showing.
mutual	He thought: "What? That fat Kiwi makes a trilogy, gets 11 Oscars, breaks MY box office record and invents new technologies? I'm no longer King of the World? Impossible!
positive	Blew the critics, many people on my country too said the same thing, it isn't in the book. What the heck? What book? the hobbit, take look at the Unfinished stories, the book itself written in 1937, the history of the hobbit, read it too, and you will see there is a story of a White Ork.
positive	To make things clear, don't listen to critics OR everyone who rated badly. From what I've read, the main complaint is that the movie didn't possess the same grandeur/feel of the lord of the rings trilogy.
positive	This movie was awesome! I didn't think that it would be as good as the LOTR trilogy, but it was! I saw the midnight showing on the day before it came out and the theater was PACKED!
positive	Your "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey" movie guide.
positive	I have been literally anxious to see 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' all year, ever since I saw the first trailer back in December of last year and some of the production videos.
positive	Being a huge Lord Of The Rings fan (my favourite films of all time) I met the Hobbit with trepidation. Especially after some of the reviews aren't as glowing as they were for the original trilogy.
positive	I was 12 when I read the entire work from JRR Tolkien for the first time. It was a revelation to me, a new world fill with magic, heroism, beauty and epic battles.
positive	After reading mixed critics I begun to worry.
positive	Watching The Hobbit might be the best movie experience I've ever had. A children's book is brought to life. The essence of fantasy culture from its origin to today's video games etc, is brought to life.
positive	Being an avid Tolkien nut, I was almost brought to tears by the beauty of this movie. Jackson did a fantastic job again. To be honest, when the movie started, I thought to myself - something is wrong here, this feels weak.
positive	I've just come home after seeing this and feel I have to tell anyone "sitting on the fence" to go and see it.
positive	I went in with an open mind despite being one of those who follows critics most of the time. To my surprise this turned out to be one of my favorite movies.
positive	I've been waiting since 2003 with a hope that someday Peter Jackson would direct The Hobbit. And nearly a decade after I saw The Return of the King in the theatre, I went back to see Middle-earth on the big screen.
positive	Okay, first off I have been waiting for this movie for many years now and had ridiculously high expectations. However, before I went and saw the midnight showing last night I read all the critics reviews to see what to expect.
positive	I went into the cinema one week after the movie came out without having read any of the critics on internet.
negative	First of all, we need to have some perspective. Roughly speaking, Middle Earth was not conceived from the outset as a coherent mythology.
positive	This brings back one of the best adventure stories of all time. And I know a lot about adventures with the fantasy and action, and this has all of it. The scenes are cool.
positive	First off this movies pacing is far better then anyone of the Lord of the Rings movies. Someone took the time to properly convey the story at a much better pace then its predecessors.
positive	CONTAINS HUGE PLOT SPOILERS REGARDING THE HOBBIT, LOTR & MIDDLE EARTH UNIVERSE
positive	I will start with saying that I am a huge fan of Tolkien's work, I've read every book at least a couple of times and love every one of them. "Hobbit" or "There and back again" was the first one I've read, back when I was still a school kid, it was and still is one of my favourite books ever.
positive	"Bilbo Baggins was a Hobbit, who lived in his hobbit-hole, and NEVER went for adventures."  Rayner Unwin, from his opening lines of his review for 'The Hobbit', 1937.
positive	Much lighter in tone than the preceding Lord of the Rings trilogy, this is more in line with a jaunty fairy tale than a fantasy epic.
positive	"The Hobbit -An Unexpected Journey" is an enjoyable movie that lives up to the high standards of director Peter Jackson's "Lord of the Rings" trilogy.
positive	I really enjoyed it, I bought LOTR box set (extended edition), I loved the 3D IMAX experience and yet there is this niggle that won't go away, the story is spread too thin, like butter.
positive	With all due respect: The title is somewhat misleading. This journey was far from unexpected. In fact, there are many in all corners of the globe who have been waiting for this journey to begin ever since Peter Jackson groundbreaking trilogy adapting J.
positive	Adapting a classic tale and turning into a big-budget visual effects driven fantasy is not everybody's cup of tea. Peter Jackson , the captain of the ship, had kept the momentum and astonished everyone with yet another knock-out film.
positive	A lot of people were skeptically when it was announced that Peter Jackson was taking JRR Tolkien's The Hobbit and turning it into a trilogy.
positive	Let me start by saying that I was pleasantly surprised when I finally watched The Hobbit on DVD last week.
positive	With the Lord of the Rings trilogy going down as some of my favourite novels and movies, and The Hobbit being one of the 1st books that I read as a young teen, I was looking forward to this movie.
positive	In 2012, a great many films were released that deserved honorable mention, but one that stands out is The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, which takes viewers back to Middle-Earth, before The Lord of the Rings.
positive	Prior to seeing this i'd heard quite a few bad reviews about The Hobbit, the main problem being that it was 'boring' and nothing much happening in it.
positive	This is a great movie. For those who enjoyed LOTR, this is more of the same fantastic stuff. The characters are well played, the action sequences are gripping, and although it's a long movie, it really didn't feel like one.
mutual	I watched the movie in HFR 3D. And that was pretty awesome. The picture quality is outstanding. Full of details, no picture noise. The 3D effect was without flaws.
positive	I really had high expectations for this movie, which probably was the problem. It is a great movie, awesome visuals and entertaining dialogue/storyline. Yet, overall when it ended it wasn't epic. I wondered how they managed only to do that much in the 2.5hrs.
positive	When i went to see this film i was a bit apprehensive because i didn't want them to mess the hobbit up like they did with the Lord of the Rings by missing out great chunks of the story.
positive	First of all, I'm not too big of a fan of The Lord of the Rings. I say that because I have never read the books but the movies are fantastic and I was very excited to see this.
positive	What can I say? I was blown away by this film -and I went in expecting a lot, after the success of the LOTR trilogy. It is definitely worth it to see this film in IMAX 3D.
positive	Was shocked anyone who likes LOTR would not like this as is evident in some of the reviews, but I am heartened that the overwhelming majority thought highly of this movie.
positive	Finally made time on New Year's Day to see this film, and was not disappointed. As with many other people, I wondered how Mr.
positive	I have just returned from my seven o'clock showing of this fantastic film in dazzling 48 fps in 3D. This film successfully manages to turn a fairly short children's book in whats going to be a epic trilogy.
mutual	I love the lord of the ring movies. I still remember my feeling when I saw the first LOTR. That is why I went to see the Hobbit. However, I was a little disappointed.
positive	The Hobbit Trilogy! Really!? I can't imagine how hard-up some Hollywood movie makers must be to stretch a single book into three separate flicks. Good viewing? Absolutely.
positive	I'll be honest; though I greatly enjoyed the Lord of the Rings movies upon their release, they never really enveloped me in quite the same way that the original Star Wars or, say, Back to the Future trilogies did.
positive	It's complicated. I think all of the casting choices were spot-on amazing, especially young Bilbo and Thorin (I intend to follow the actor's career for so long as he has one). I think the cheap laughs and bogus cameos were indeed cheap and bogus.
positive	Films like this have usually enthusiastic fans and gloomy skeptics - but they are not uninviting.
positive	This is about as conflicted as it gets for me. The LOTR trilogy comprise some of the greatest movies ever made by my account, so why wouldn't I want Peter Jackson to bring us back to Tolkien's magical world?
positive	Well, I honestly don't know why so many people are annoyed by the movie itself and the new technology.
positive	Baggy, never-ending goings on, going on in Bag End, give way finally to a surprisingly sprightly adventure for such a behemoth of a movie.
positive	So finally i watch Hobbit and i was so happy, and I'm so glad I did not listen to criticism of the film, which is unfair in every way. Movie is so amazing so full off life ,and it was best shielded book ever.
positive	It's been nearly nine years since we last voyaged through the mystical world of middle earth. But just when we thought nothing could surpass that incredible experience, Peter Jackson decides to gift us an early Christmas present with - The Hobbit.
positive	The internet is filled with negative reviews about hobbit and how Peter Jackson took it a bit too far when he decided to split the book into 3 feature length movies.
positive	I have to say, I really enjoyed this. Did it drag at the beginning? I didn't think so, but I can understand why some might say it did. Did it deviate from the book?
mutual	Let me use the standard preface... I am a die hard Tolkien fan, and I loved the previous LOTR films. I still love the story, I'm not a fan of this film. 
positive	I was 15 when return of the king came out and have been waiting 9 years for Peter Jackson to take us back to Middle Earth in The Hobbit. It's finally here and it doesn't disappoint.
positive	As far as enormous motion pictures go, this trilogy opener is right up there.
positive	I could not be a bigger fan of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. They are without doubt, the best films in the world. I had heard mixed reviews of the Hobbit, and wasn't too sure what to expect.
positive	Managed to see the film in 3D and High Frame Rate 48 FPS. The 3D was fine, but the 48FPS was awful. I won't say it ruined the film, because that's not fair.
mutual	I'm a little surprised to find that most people are giving either very high or very low scores to this film. I'm surprised because the movie felt a little 'middle of the road' to me. It had GREAT parts, and it had not so great parts. It doesn't triumph; it doesn't fall flat on its face.
positive	"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey" is mostly what you'd expect it to be. If you've seen Peter Jackson's "LOTR Trilogy" and have been keeping an eye on the TV spots and movie trailers, it's just like that.
positive	First off, let me say that The Hobbit was a masterpiece. I have been following this film since I first heard that there was a possibility of it, back when there was rumors of casting Elijah Wood as Bilbo.
positive	I'm not here to smash The Hobbit or favour it, I'm just going to put it in perspective of a viewer and a fan. Peter Jackson's way of displaying the story was different. This can be portrayed as either good or bad.
positive	I must admit that I had high hopes when I went to see The Hobbit, but with a question of how a relatively short book could be turned into 7 or so hours of film over the 3 instalments.
positive	We just saw The Hobbit - based on one of my all-time favorite books. I have seen reviews of The Hobbit that criticized the 48fr version and generally felt that the show was a bit slow and dull due to the fact that they are making 3 movies out of one book.
positive	If there is such a thing as a 'runt of the litter' when discussing arguably the greatest trilogy of all time, then it can equally be said that The Hobbit is certainly no weaker than the weakest Lord of the Rings film.
positive	Forget what the critics say abut this film. The Hobbit is the same grand, epic spectacle we have come to expect from Peter Jackson and co.
positive	I have heard many people complaining that,no matter how good the Lord Of The Rings trilogy is,it never came to be nearly as good as the book. I must admit,it was true,but it was one hell of an attempt.
positive	Peter Jackson's new journey into Middle Earth is an extremely entertaining and well constructed movie.
positive	Watched this yesterday in 3D IMAX and have to say it is truly entertaining. There is no point in comparing it with the Lord of the Rings trilogy which has an epic feel to it where the hobbit does not.
positive	Anyone expecting another Lord of The Rings will probably be disappointed in this movie - but of course, the original books were quite different in tone and in scope, and their film adaptations reflect that.
positive	The cinematic return to Middle-Earth is one that I have anticipated for almost a decade. Having fallen in love with the Lord of the Rings trilogy, I eagerly awaited the adaptation of Tolkien's prelude.
positive	It was all those many years ago when Peter Jackson's Epic "Lord of the Rings" Trilogy hit big in the early Noughties.
positive	First of all, I saw this is 2d, which slightly dampened the experience because I could tell that some sequences were shot for 3d. I also saw it at 24 fps, and it looked beautiful so no complaints there.
positive	An absolutely stunning fantasy adventure. I was enthralled from start to finish. Does it help to know the book, and the mythical background?
positive	"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey" is the first installment in the highly-anticipated "The Hobbit" trilogy, setting as a prequel to the original Lord of the Rings films, based on J.
positive	I don't understand much of the criticism of movie critics and the reviewers on IMDb. They complain that the movie takes too long to get going. They apparently expected a non-stop action driven movie.
positive	This my is my first ever review and is mainly about my experience with the new HFR (48fps)
positive	The 5k, 48 frame per second, 3D footage w/ Dolby Atmos is truly incredible.
positive	Hobbits, wizards, dwarfs, elves, trolls, goblins, and dragons adorn this wonderful movie. I have read The Hobbit and all three of the Lord of the Rings books more than once.
positive	Before I begin this review I would like to say I am a HUGE fan of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.
positive	I think most of the critics don't realize that this book the hobbit is a different kind of novel/book, it was made for kids and the lord of the rings is more serious and darker, the movie shows us what it really meant to be, fun, adventures, and even humor, there are 13 dwarfs.
positive	The user reviews are a more accurate reflection of the films quality and entertainment value.
positive	I'll try to keep this short and simple, not going into great detail, starting with the good stuff: The effort put into making this film has definitely paid off.
positive	From all the complaints I have been seeing of "The Hobbit", it tells me that peoples expectations were way too high, which happens way too often.
positive	I couldn't wait for this movie. I took my beautiful date Terra and my beautiful friend Gina and it would be a glorious night. But dang, is this movie long! I think it covered more than half the book!
negative	That can be the only explanation I can think of. Crude jokes, tons of violence, nonstop action, and everyone an action hero - sounds more like a Schwarzenegger film than a Tolkien story.
positive	Okay, so let me preface my review by saying that I'm, in general, a sucker for critics' reviews. I'm like that friend of yours who refuses to see a movie at the theater unless it has a minimum of a 70% rating on rottentomatoes or metacritic.
positive	I've rated this film a 8 as it is no where near as good as the LOTR series which i rated 9/10.
positive	Some examples of the low points of the movie, that merely chew up time unproductively: .
positive	The first thing I must say about film makers doing classic works like this, is that you stick to the storyline. Peter Jackson has run roughshod over this by adding characters that were never in the book.
positive	The dilemma of delivering movies of baronial proportions such as the Lord of The Rings trilogy is that the makers can seldom revivify their own brilliance. The same is the case with The Hobbit.
positive	I will start with the bad, many reviews have discussed this at length, in truth the beginning could have used a bit of tightening, however when the Dwarfs began to sing the folk songs of old, I grinned from ear to ear yes its in the books.
positive	This movie was everything and beyond what I had expected. I was actually a little afraid that I would have so high expectations on this movie, that I would find it to fall short.
positive	If you love Lord of the Rings then you will love this...some have said the film is too long but i say : if the idea of being able to spend three thrilling hours in professor Tolkien's world fires your imagination then don't hesitate in seeing this movie.
positive	Warning: This is not a review in its truest sense.
positive	Peter Jackson has done it again, with an utterly brilliant adaption of the first third of the classic novel "The Hobbit", augmented for the better with material from the Appendix of "Return Of The King.
positive	What a stunning adaption. Peter Jackson has smashed it again bringing to life J.R.R Tolkien's children's novel into a cinema masterpiece an epic journey on screen.
positive	I went and saw this movie in 48 FPS, 3D tonight. I want to start by saying that first of all, I've never been a fan of 3D. I find that every so often, Hollywood tries to revive 3D and sell it on us.
positive	Simply put- this movie is near perfect. From the gorgeous opening sequence and stunning vistas, to Rivendell, plains and everywhere else it is almost pitch perfect.
positive	***SPOILERS BELOW*** Alright. The first thing I thought when I walked out of the movie theater was how disappointing it was. But now you're thinking, "Well then why Matthew G, did you give the movie an 8/10?
positive	I had been in withdrawal since LOTR ended so many years back. I do miss the characters and the settings it transported some of us into.
positive	I am not a Peter Jackson fanatic, I am not a Hobbit Lover, I am not particularly fond of Fantasy, yet I just loved this movie.
positive	The Hobbit ; An Unexpected Journey (Hfr) (3D) (U/A) English ----my Rating : 4/5 stars VERY GOOD
positive	I just came back from the movie and I felt a strong urge to write a review on it. I have never written a review before on anything, so I registered to IMDb and just started writing this.
mutual	After perceiving all these mixed critical views on the movie, I simply had to see the movie myself to investigate the fuzz(3D, upgraded fps).
positive	As of 2012 and 2013, the initial reaction is to compare the fantasy journey among noble dwarfs and elves, and ignoble orcs and trolls, to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which technically occurs after this adventure.
positive	I don't understand why there is so much negative review among critics. The movie is simply: very good entertainment. Yes, it is lighter and funnier than LOTR but it doesn't mean that it is worse.
positive	The Short: Wonderfully cast, incredibly shot, relentlessly adventurous, and an (almost) spot on adaptation of the beloved classic, the first chapter in this highly anticipated trilogy doesn't disappoint in the slightest.
positive	I really don't understand all the hate that seems to surround this movie. It's only been out for some days, and hate is already streaming on the internet.
positive	When I read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings as a result of wanting to know more about the story behind the 1977 animated special, I got a very clear picture in my head of what a live-action movie would look like.
positive	I LOVED Lord of the Rings. Each movie I saw several times in the theater. Once the extended versions came out, I watched every bit of them, even the commentaries. I was addicted. So unfortunately The Hobbit will be compared to those movies, can't be helped.
positive	Sir Peter Jackson's adaption of J.R.R Tolkiens epic, The Lord of the Rings, was a masterpiece. The audience's attachment to the characters was unparalleled as was the cinematography and vistas.
positive	I was a little worried about going to see this movie after some of the early reviews going on about pacing issues and the length being unnecessary and so on.
positive	There is already over 200 reviews, so I'm sure everything has been said by now, but I am still going to review it.
positive	This is not a traditional review of The Hobbit, more of a focus on the writing and directorial choices rather than music, acting or high frame rate.
positive	I was very young when I first saw "The Lord of the Rings Trilogy" and it was without questioning one of the greatest sagas of movie franchising.
positive	I saw The Hobbit last night in 3D IMAX. I'm not a great fan of 3D and this film only has a few scenes where it makes a big impact. My theatre did not project in 48 fps so I can't comment on that.
positive	The hobbit was really good but there was some things i didn't like and you will probably agree with me. First lets go trough the good things the high framrate was really good and blent in perfectly with action scenes.
positive	Going into the film, I was confident that this would be an excellent film, as I know Peter Jackson wouldn't air anything close to an average film.
positive	The original Lord of the Rings is one of the best novel series and film series ever and it has been a long journey for the adaptation of The Hobbit. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a welcome returned to Middle-Earth, even if it does not match the heights of the original trilogy.
positive	The making of the Hobbit is a story to tell in its own right with film rights being tossed around in legal battles for years before the MGM finally obtained everything it needed to get the production moving.
positive	2 hours and 40 minutes flew by, while I sat in awe of the magnificent spectacle in front of me. Peter Jackson and the entire crew has done it again with The Hobbit.
positive	Sometimes I get the feeling that professional critics want something to fail. Sometimes I think they enforce the idiom 'pride comes before a fall', and want previous successes to be tempered by present failure.
positive	I have watched the movie at 48 fps with 3D and it was simply AWESOME. I will say the first 5 minutes may make you feel uncomfortable but after that it was great.
positive	We've waited so long for this movie to come and my expectations we're completely fulfilled, when I saw this movie.
positive	you remember when the first LOTR came? it gave the idea to the movie lovers that YES, something great has begun. That's what i felt after seeing this movie.
positive	OK, so it wasn't perfect. However, it was still a great film that did a great job of bringing "The Hobbit" to life.
positive	Let me start by saying that I have read the books a long time ago (both the LotR series and the Hobbit), as well as a wide array from the fantasy genre.
positive	Why did I vote this new movie, an amazing start for a trilogy 10 out of 10.
negative	I was going into this movie hoping to see one, but what i got was something else...something that ate my soul forever. about half way through i said to my self all this movie is.
positive	I was rubbing my eyes, trying to convince myself that i don't see the credits. Fastest 169 minutes of my life, and i didn't watch it in 48fps, only 3D.
positive	I loved the Tolkien works so much as a kid that I often have mixed feelings with Jackson's work - he does a great job of casting and cinematography, but goes overboard where I don't think it's necessary.
positive	An Unexpected Journey is an adaptation of The Hobbit, or There and Back Again written by J. R. R. Tolkien. However, it serves more as a prequel to The Lord of the Rings than an adaptation of Tolkien's book.
negative	As an artist and a human being, I am truly appalled at this travesty. I mean, this is it! This is the movie that has finally inspired me to create a Bottom 100 Movies of All Time list!
negative	I was looking forward to this title, but unfortunately it had me bored.
mutual	I watched this movie in "High Frame Rate 3D" This was similar to "Movie Plus" on my Samsung which I disabled because I did not like it one bit.
mutual	This film is mildly recommended.
mutual	This review is going to sound harsh, so before i begin, I am an avid fan of fantasy literature, especially High fantasy, and The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings are of course central to that genre.
positive	The critics try to compare this movie to LOTR and that is why they are disappointed with the outcome of this film. LOTR is a more mature movie based on a more mature book series. The Hobbit was made as a children's book and therefore the movie comes off a bit more childlike.
positive	I saw the movie on 12/12/12 in Zurich. Our party purposely booked the 48FPS 3D version. We had to check out that new technology.
positive	Dear denizen of IMDb:
positive	I had huge expectations before watching this movie and I was certainly not disappointed!
positive	*it says spoiler but I only put that because I mentioned some names of the characters but I dare not give away parts of this beauty you have to see for yourself* This film is simply put Brilliant!
positive	I went the day it was released to watch it at 12.30pm to a virtually empty cinema - which was nice.
positive	This is my first time reviewing a movie here on IMDb, and the main reason is this: Though overall a good movie, some aspects of it left me deeply unsatisfied.
positive	Now, I know all the fanboys out there who are like guardians of this movie are going to be like, WHAT, NO, THIS IS A PERFECT MOVIE, HOW DARE YOU EVEN SUGGEST THERE ARE SLIGHT ERRORS IN THIS WONDERFUL MASTERPIECE.
positive	Let me tell right from the start that I generally hate anything Hollywood produces today, and that I found the LOTR good bur very flawed. Not anywhere near to the masterpieces some would like us to believe.
negative	If not for the action packed final hour of this film, "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey" would have been more of a disappointment than it already was.
negative	In LORD OF THE RINGS, the old Bilbo compares wearing the ring  and the weight it bore upon his soul  as butter stretched onto too much bread. That's exactly what director Peter Jackson does to THE HOBBIT, at least judging by this overlong first outing of three completed films.
positive	To begin with the first form of embellishment is to immediately address the concern that Jackson and co.
mutual	Long have I awaited a resemblance of the experience of authentic epicness set by the lord of the rings trilogy! That trilogy was indeed prolonged by a new franchise called "the hobbit" aiming to offer the same experience.
positive	This is for me, a Visiually stunning movie. I've seen it twice in 48 fps and it was a bit unusual the first time, i loved it the second time, and got more used to it. A visually masterpiece.
positive	This will be a short one.
positive	Personally I think that the reviews which I heard before watching the film about it being bad and not up to the standard of lord of the rings are all wrong, to be fair it was not up to lord of the rings standards, but the way people judged it so harshly was very unfair.
positive	I like LOTR and so I definitely would follow the Hobbit Trilogy. To me, the Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is still entertaining though the formula to entertain hasn't changed quite much.
mutual	Don't hate me... and YES, I love this movie series, but I can say with all honesty that I was a bit disappointed with this one. It is certain that the die-hard fans that are rating it EPIC, 10/10 etc.
mutual	This is not the book. This is not the LOTR trilogy.
positive	the hobbit, well what about this film is a pleasant return home, in the middle ground more beautiful than ever thanks to the new 48fps a bit 'annoying amazing beginning with the passage of time.
positive	As soon as the opening titles hit and the familiar music began to play, I got teary eyed. This was like a reunion of sorts, with characters who you never wanted to part with while at the same time introducing new characters who you'd love to be friends with.
positive	Peter Jackson you are my hero!
positive	That film was amazing, it delivered on all fronts. From watching all the makings of etc I can see that all the planning and behind the scenes was done wonderfully.
positive	Hobbit is the one the best movie ever i have seen. The visual effect and the animation still take my heart whenever I watch Hobbit. I am anxiously waiting for the upcoming hobbit the desolation of samang.
positive	Sometimes it's just pure mastercraft you have to bow to. Call anybody a Peter Jackson's Groupie, he still would have loads of efforts to achieve a convenient homage to what has been shown on screen.
positive	This is my first review but I had to create a account and rate this movie.
positive	Problems:
positive	See this film NOW!!! The Hobbit is.....bloody perfect.
positive	I watch movies for the visuals as much as the story and I used to think there was no such thing as too much action but this film changed my mind about that.
positive	I've seen it three times now: first in 3d 24f/s in french, second time still in french in 3d 48f/s and finally in English.
positive	I have to say I really liked the LoTR trilogy and I went with high expectations to The Hobbit.
positive	First things first, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey does not meet that ridiculously good standards of any of the Lord of the Rings films.
positive	I went into the Hobbit really excited and i must say i came out of the cinema a really happy man.
positive	12/16/2012 I saw 'The Hobbit' today in 24 FPS and 3D. And I was honestly blown away. This film was great in every aspect.
positive	Well, to begin with - this movie is for those who just hadn't had enough of the Middle-Earth adventures with the almost 10 hours saga of LOTR. And I am one of those.
positive	Prior to my viewing of The Hobbit - An Unexpected Journey, I had read a significant amount of professional critics, eager to know if the movie's quality would live up to the quality of its predecessors, the Lord Of The Rings.
positive	Song, cheer, epic quest, triumph over evil, deep characters, real plot, heavenly vistas, awesome dialogue, super long, took 6 year old and he sat through a 3 hour movie because this is awesome and fun to watch.
positive	In an ideal world, The Hobbit would have been adapted, screened and served as a suitable hors d'oeuvres before the main event, the Lord of the Rings (LOTR) trilogy.
positive	The key to enjoying this movie is this: don't compare it to The Lord of the Rings.
positive	It was a job well done. However, if you are not familiar with Tolkien's work it is going to make you ask too many question. I personally recommend watching the LOTR before watching it. It can help you a lot.
positive	I was interested in seeing this in the High Frame Rate format, and only High Frame Rate showing I could find was also in 3D so I took that one.
positive	At first I was put off by a number of negative reviews.I hesitated to watch the movie because of this and my expectations were rather low.
positive	Unlike critics and fan boys and everyone else in between, I went to see "The Hobbit" with zero expectations. I loved the the LOTR, as I believe they are masterpieces that will not be remade in my lifetime or ever.
positive	This review is going to be spoiler free.
positive	I have seen the first two movies of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and have read the Hobbit when I was in elementary school. I didn't realize the film was done by Peter Jackson, until the end.
negative	First of all, let me give you a short anecdote of what happened to me while I was watching this movie in the theater.
mutual	I thought The Hobbit was... pretty good. It was a nice visit back to Middle Earth. A little drawn out (three movies... really?) but at the same time, the characters besides Bilbo and Gandalf remain very thinly drawn.
positive	First off i loved this movie. But I don't understand two things and I think that the second of the three movies will be the one that suffers from this stupidity.
positive	Having seen the original Lord of the Rings trilogy too many times to count, I had certain expectations for The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. Fortunately, many of those inner-most needs I possessed were met, however, there will still a few stumbling points within the movie itself.
positive	I was really skeptical about The Hobbit: an Unexpected Journey for a few reasons: 48 frames per second, being the first part of a trilogy and still managing a long run-time, and general bad word of mouth I've been hearing.
positive	The Hobbit is a book aimed at a younger audience, and the film reflects that, which will make some fans of the LOTR trilogy disappointed if they wanted the same experience. To put it simply, LOTR for me are better movies, while The Hobbit is a better adaptation.
positive	REVIEW: THE HOBBIT (JACKSON, 2012)
positive	Well, let's get the worst out of the way first. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is clearly the most unbalanced entry of the Jackson's Tolkien movies.
positive	"Home is now behind you. The world is ahead."- Gandalf
positive	Hubby and I are avid movie fans - we go out to the show a couple of times a month to see new and fading fast flicks.
positive	This movie was supposed to be filmed with the same film stock (Kodak 3256) used to film E.T. but since there was not enough film available, the director decided to film it at twice the speed of normal speed.
positive	It's the Hobbit and it's Peter Jackson! I can't say I'm one of the 'great fans' of Tolkien, but I did enjoy LOTR and have good childhood memories of the Hobbit. So here goes.
positive	I am a big fan of Tolkien's work and hence with all those visual effects the movie was quite fantastic. However, what I disliked about it is the overall concept of covering it in 3 movies.
positive	On rare occasions, I find myself getting very excited for a movie's release the moment I learn about it. The Hobbit was one of those movies for me.
positive	Peter Jackson once again proves his aptitude for making films, and in particular the works of Tolkien. The cinematography was stunning, the acting (especially by Ian McKellen and Andy Serkis) was impeccable, and the story was exhilarating.
positive	Where do i begin, this was simply an absolute joy to watch nearly 3 hours long it felt like only minutes went by. there was never a dull moment the scenery the way it was filmed was nothing short of spectacular.
positive	I had already posted my thoughts on this film after seeing it in 2D, but thought I would now do so after seeing it in 3D 48 HFR last night.
positive	An Absolute Stunner!I have always been a great fan of Tolkien's works and Peter Jackson has so far done an excellent job in adapting his books.
positive	Just saw this movie in the 48FPS 3D screen and I should say the experience was simply fantastic.
positive	The Hobbit, An Unexpected Journey is a wondrous film adaptation of the beloved book, faithfully brought to life and lovingly enriched by Peter Jackson and his troupe. It is thoroughly enjoyable, I can see myself re-watching it many times.
positive	The first thing that came in my mind when seeing the title at the opening credits is: WOO HOO! Finally a decade after RotK, I finally could experience another adaptation of Tolkien's Middle Earth, on the big screen. Been anticipating this since I saw the trailer like a year ago.
positive	I have read many of the reviews here, some written with the finite appreciation and esoteric knowledge of not only the 3 Peter Jackson projects but of all the works of Tolkien.
positive	This movie is great. I'm not a huge LOTR fan or Hobbit fan by any means, but I have read all of the books once before. With that being said, it's been years since I've read The Hobbit, so much of the story is stored away in the depths of my memory...
positive	I never thought I was going to write something here dedicated to a movie, but I must say its well worth an exception.
positive	The Hobbit movie review- Expectedly good :)
positive	OK. I was one of the many who guffawed at the idea of this relatively short book being turned into a trilogy. I assumed this was a box office ploy, plain and simple.
positive	Firstly let me clarify that I saw the movie in HFR, so if you find me rambling off into the wilderness, let me be.
mutual	The good news is, THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY will satisfy (a lot) of die-hard fans who have read the J.R.R. Tolkien's book.
positive	For Lord of the Rings, the transition from the book to the film, left one with mixed feelings at times, partly because much of the content was snipped, and didn't make it, eve
positive	Finally, after waiting 9 years since the Lord of the Rings trilogy ended, I got to revisit Middle Earth for a few hours. We went to the 10:20pm showing, arriving a little later to get good seats.
positive	When I went into this movie, I couldn't help comparing it to its predecessors. I'm not only talking about the Lord of the Rings trilogy and how well it would tie in to those movies.
positive	Just watched it in Bath and loved it!...I was the one with the wooden sword any Bath residents reading this. Anyway,the LOTR trilogy are my favourite films and I've read and loved the Hobbit novel.
positive	I saw this in Digital Cinema instead of high frame rate or 3D. In some places the panoramic views were blurry. The close ups were all very clear and I don't think it detracted too much from the overall experience.
positive	I was afraid of the fact that the story was split in 3 separate movies. However, I still hoped it would turn out for the best and I'm glad I wasn't disappointed.
positive	Bilbo Baggins is swept into a quest to reclaim the lost Dwarf Kingdom of Erebor from the fearsome dragon Smaug.
positive	Yes the graphics are amazing, the music is out of this world, the scenery fantastic, I give it full marks... but I have also read the book and feel comfortable understanding the characters involved .
positive	As a huge fan of Tolkien, and of course having read The Hobbit, I had no idea how Peter Jackson could split The Hobbit - a much shorter book than Lord of the Rings (LOTR) - into a trilogy, nor how I could sit through such a long film without getting a little bored.
positive	I saw the film in 3D IMAX format. The 48 per second rather than the normal 24 frames certainly improved the viewing on the IMAX screen.
mutual	This film entertains while failing to enthrall as did its older brother, LOTR. I sat with a frown on my face for most of the running time, relieved by two or three chuckles.
positive	This review is coming from a person that has not read the book.
positive	Concerning Hobbits,
positive	From the great list of directors the world has seen, none are more deserving to be called the king of fantasy than Peter Jackson. His ability to adapt material & transport an audience is incredible.
positive	The movie follows the content closely while adding some well placed additions to create the movie. I highly recommend people to watch this movie.
positive	I went to the midnight opening for this movie. And,the theater was only filled to about 80% capacity. I think is a slight protest for having the film company choose to make this 1 book into 3 movies.
positive	I love the Hobbit. Great Book. The film was good but...
positive	I'm a huge fan of the LOTR movies and I've tried to read the books. I'm not good with books and I don't like spending time on reading books but I did it for LOTR because I love the movies.
positive	This movie was fantastic. I was not disappointment at all. Absolutely LOVED the entire experience! All those so called professional movie reviewers are crazy giving this movie a bad review. They must have watched a different movie.
positive	If given the option of describing this movie in one word, in all modesty, I would call it "Spectacular". Then again, after the multi-award winning THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, how can you expect any less?
positive	If Jackson and the guys wanted to make a hit out of the Hobbit, they should had considered making only one movie instead of a trilogy.
positive	Technical Execution Words really don't do this film justice when seen in high resolution IMAX format in 3D. The high frame rate, from my perspective, was an incredibly positive aspect to the film.
positive	Peter Jackson did it again.
mutual	I read both the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and the Hobbit. As many others have mentioned, the Hobbit is a pocket, maybe 1 tenth of the number of pages compared to the LOTR trilogy.
positive	The only reason I rated it a 10 is because that is as high as this site allows. I would rate it a 20 if I could. Too long, as some reviewers have suggested? Nonsense!
positive	First of all, if this movie came before the entire LOTR trilogy, it would have amassed billions upon billions of $$. It's everything a prequel SHOULD be.
positive	Outside of 'Star Wars Episodes I-III,' there haven't been a lot of super successful prequels. And since their release, there seems to have been unease about ones to other films being made.
positive	I waited long enough to see this movie, read far too many negative reviews from professional critics and was prepared for more than a little disappointment. I need not have worried.
positive	I must say I was very skeptical since I know the book and it might be very difficult to make more than one movie based on that story.
positive	I read The Hobbit again before going to the film and I can say that I probably prefer the book but i did enjoy seeing how they had made the film.
positive	Maybe as a movie this was just good. But as a Tolkien adaptation it was brave, marvelous and almost better than the Lord of the Rings.
positive	I read the hobbit as a child an considered it to be my first "novel". When I went to watch it with my wife I was eager to see it and was afraid that like LOTR, it might get cut short.
positive	Yep, I said it, better than the book so far! Some critics panned the Hobbit for taking too long to get going, too much unnecessary padding, and not all the Dwarfs get much to do.
positive	I'm a die hard Tolkien fan who has read everything I got my hands into by the age of 15. I first picked LOTR when I was 10 and have been lost ever since into the undying lands, Valinor and middle earth.
positive	Personally speaking I went in with a lot of expectations with the movie,I was so excited that I literally dragged myself to the cinema hall on a weekday taking a sick leave fr
positive	This movie is a masterpiece & is the reason for my bizarre overstatement. You can look at it in a million ways.. Yep he overdid it in a few places.. Yep he went overboard..
positive	Background about my expectations: I am a huge Tolkien fan. I didn't expect to enjoy this movie that much because The Hobbit is a kid's book. I read it when I was 5.
mutual	On the plus side my 8yr old and 11yr old absolutely loved it. 11yr old said it was better than Harry P, which is praise indeed as he is an HP nut. For me as a 40-something Tolkien and PJ fan (who loved the LOTR films) I think the critics have it about right.
positive	The Hobbit brings Middle Earth alive in ways not seen during the preceding LOTR trilogy. Peter Jackson seems to be getting better in serving grand spectacles with every iteration.
positive	The Hobbit : An Unexpected Journey directed by Peter Jackson. The team of 17 Oscars of "The Lord of the Rings Trilogy" is back with another trilogy. The Lord of the Rings Trilogy is by far the greatest adventure story put together on screen.
positive	I'd been anxiously awaiting The Hobbit for a while now, and I have certainly not been the only one.
positive	First off, before writing this review, I am a huge Lord of the Rings fan and I have seen all of them hundreds of times, but The Hobbit exceeded my expectations and (in my opinion) is better than The Fellowship of the Ring.
positive	At first I didn't know that Jackson was filming three movies. I was under the impression that it was just one film. Now that I know two more movies are on their way, I must say that this is a masterpiece of film, one for the ages!
positive	First time i write a review on a film... I am not a big fan of fantasy films, but since in Italy it was the only film which was opening in original language me and my wife decided to go. I told to her if it is as bad as critics say we will have at least 3 hours of good sleep...
positive	Having been a fan of Peter jackson's since the Frighteners, I am well aware that when you are going to see a peter Jackson film expect a certain amount of great visuals and expect great acting even if the story line tends to suffer a tiny bit.
positive	Through 9 long years, we have endured starts and delays time and again, waiting for that fateful return to the Middle-Earth film fans have come to know and love.
positive	Well, to say that this movie is state of the art seems an understatement.
positive	First off I have heard a lot about pacing and that the movie is too long. This is true, but not in a bad way.
positive	I will not review the story because if you are interested you already know it. With one word the film is awesome!
positive	It is hard to describe film, because the words are so pour, it is absolute marvelous! I finally felt that the story was coherent, with no gaps like in The Lord Of The Rings..
positive	I watched this movie last night at our local cinema. I didn't see it in 48 fps 3d, but it wasn't necessary since the magic of Middle earth doesn't need 3d to feel real.
positive	Hello my friends! It's Robbie K back with another review after coming off of a two week dry spell, and what a movie to return to.
positive	I've actually decided to ignore all "professional" critiques of the movie and see it and judge for myself. As a big Hobbit/LOTR fan (books) I must say the Hobbit did the book more justice than the LOTR movies did for that book.
positive	Finally, I came out of the theater of the long-awaited Hobbit. I have to write a word , I was thrilled. Excellent actors , design , effects and music with an ingenious plot -centric bridge to the Lord of the Rings .
positive	In Lord of the rings , When Bilbo Baggins first finds the ring , from Golum , he was an older man ( Ian Holm).This scene is on Lord of the rings : fellowship of the ring.
positive	When I was growing up the lord of the rings was being released and because I was young I didn't really get the full enjoyment out of Lord of the Rings due to the fact I couldn't get into the movie as I didn't understand most of it.
positive	I was told that 48 frames/sec would make me woozy, will downgrade the movie in your mind and would not do justice to the film and inturn ruin it.
positive	I enjoyed the movie throughout and I find myself with more desire to watch it again than the first time round.
positive	As a big fan of the Tolkien Hobbit and Lord of the Rings books, then the LotR movies, frankly I did not hold much hope that The Hobbit would be as good as its predecessor movies. From the movie trailers I had seen, I was not impressed with the actor who plays Bilbo. But I went to see it anyway.
positive	I definitely rate this as excellent. Today was the opening day in the U.S.
positive	Since Sir Peter Jackson's last foray into Middle Earth, he's created the fantastic (King Kong) and the fantastically awful (The Lovely Bones), and now we're back and it's like we never left.
positive	I truly don't understand all the hate for this movie. I know there are intentional haters like die-hard Nolan fans (one of my best friends is a HUGE Nolan fan, but not this intense) who are purposely disliking any other movie this year just to let Dark Knight Rises win awards.
positive	"What has it got in its pocketses ? " A used Hobbit movie ticket , precious .
positive	As a huge Tolkien fan, it was with mixed fear and excitement that I went to see the Hobbit: an unexpected journey, last night. I was really worried about how Jackson was going to extend the Hobbit into three films.
positive	There are a couple of kinds of people that will not find this movie to their tastes. Firstly those that, for whatever reason, don't like the fantasy genre itself (of which there seems to be quite a few movie critics).
positive	After many critics gave this film a negative review for several reasons, I decided to see it for myself. I watched it and discovered the criticisms were a mixture of ignorance and pettiness.
positive	Hobbit: Unexpected Journey
positive	The Hobbit manages to capture the same feel of the lord of the rings. It's great to see a sequel that isn't necessary bigger but is an expansion on the lore.
mutual	One of the most anticipated movies of the year, The Hobbit attempts to rekindle the glory of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings, but falls to mediocrity. Though the same feel was mostly achieved, its reach extended its grasp; simply put, The Hobbit should not have been split into three parts.
positive	Now, before I begin, I want you to feel where I am coming from.
positive	Wow, where to start?
positive	The Lord of Rings Trilogy by J R R Tolkien could be considered one of mankind's magnificent literary works. Tolkien wrote a true epic complete with supporting languages, maps and what not.
positive	Peter Jackson has made what I would say is the one of the closes book adaptions I've ever seen. This movie is based on one of my favorite books and Peter Jackson has brought it to life.
positive	The movie is good,I can't say it couldn't be better,but i expected more to be honest.We all know that book was written for kids,and we are aware of it,but the movie is to much based on younger fans.
positive	After reading some of the mainstream critics reviews I was kind of a reluctant to go and watch the Hobbit for fear that I would be disappointed in the same way I was after watching the Dark Knight Rises.
positive	This is the first review I write and it's for this movie. That means something...
positive	This first Hobbit movie follows the plot of the first half of the book more or less faithfully.
mutual	The over the top complex action scenes were a little too Goofy for me. I am calling them Goofy because they reminded me of a Goofy cartoon where the action is so ridiculous and out there that it's almost laughable.
mutual	When it was announced that Peter Jackson (The Lord of the Rings Trilogy) would be extending The Hobbit into a trilogy, many wondered how the director would manage to stretch a seemingly brief story into roughly 9 hours worth of epic filmmaking.
positive	When I heard they were going to make 3 movies with this little book: "The Hobbit", which I read awhile back, I immediately thought corporate greed, that they should be ashamed and it was going to ruin the franchise.
positive	Hi, this is my first review but i must speak out from the appalling reviews i have heard from many sources, and put them to rest.
positive	I walked into the cinema filled with apprehension and a sense of foreboding. I'd read many of the criticisms of the HFR, and was filled with dread.
positive	I have seen the movie today. It was great and the 3d effects where super in the new High Frame Rate(48fps in stead of 24fps).
positive	I mean this movie has so much to see and take in, Every detail , the creatures from orcs and goblins to trolls and monsters that are literally made out of the mountains - this movie is a wonderful orgasm for the eyes.
positive	The Movie itself is brilliant, the high quality of the screen and the movie bring a reality to the viewers. Peter Jackson once again has done a great job sending us the picture of the Middle Earth, once again it is magnificent.
positive	The Hobbit, as a book, and as a story is a little weaker when compared to those of LOTR. But this movie for a change, outshines the book.... everything about this movie is awesome.
positive	This movie is an experience you do NOT want to miss out on. Cast aside all your worries about 48 FPS because what Peter Jackson has done is truly revolutionary in terms of visual media.
positive	Few non-elven words can describe how pleasantly surprised I was by this film. At first, I was seeing the movie simply because I wanted to experience the new 48 fps and what better way to do that than taking a trip back to Middle-Earth.
positive	This review is going to be very short, because I am still completely blown away. It rendered me speechless. I saw the Hobbit last night and I can't stop being in the movie, in my head.
positive	Well this 2 hours and 40 minutes felt like too short :)
positive	It's been a while since I have last seen a movie that solidly good and qualitative in any respect. Absolutely amazed by the visual effects, the beauty of every single scene/shot.
positive	The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is one word: masterpiece. Upon looking at the user reviews I found many of them were negative, So I thought to myself: Who could've possibly disliked this movie.
positive	The most stupid comment about the movie was "its too real, it reminds me of a documentary!!!". And i guess that that summarize 99% of the problems with the title...
positive	I was very taken aback, as well as disappointed, at the many negative reviews coming from critics. It did seem, however, that most of the negative reviews revolved around a couple of key point: the technology, and the pacing.
positive	The Hobbit is a superb film compared to the vast majority of other films ever made.
mutual	First of all i am going to compare it to Lord of the Rings trilogy , how can you not. Im afraid this leaves a lot to be desired , can honestly say i'm disappointed and not on the edge of my seat waiting for the next instalment, why ?
positive	Timid Hobbit Bilbo Baggins is recruited by wizard Gandalf the Grey to accompany a dozen dwarfs on a quest to wrest their home back from a usurping dragon called Smaug.
positive	I'm not going to spoil this for anyone so therefore this will be a rather short review.
positive	I'm probably too traditional and old fashioned for my own good. I'm pretty close to senior citizen status, so 3D and this new fangled 48 frames per second business isn't something that whets my appetite enough to make me veer from watching films in a conventional format.
mutual	Making a film from a book comes down not to "intent," but spirit. We can debate an author's "intent" for ages, but spirit is something more universally agreed upon.
negative	Movie Had too much potential, I'm very disappointed and saddened as a huge LOTR enthusiast (greatest movies of all time).
positive	The fairest thing you can say about the first film of Peter Jackson's The Hobbit prequel trilogy is that it compares favourably to The Phantom Menace, its equivalent in the Star Wars franchise.
positive	How can this movie have 8,5 it's outrageous. Basically it's a bad prequel from the LOTR trilogy. I gave it a 7 but honestly the 3D was unnecessary and also Bilbo such bad acting i just wanted to leave the theater.
positive	"Peter Jackson's return to Middle Earth is not a welcome one because for a story that seems simple he has decided to stretch it out which creates a mix of good and bad results in a poor attempt to start a three film set"
positive	This movie was absolutely perfect, and the critics are dead wrong. The cg is great, the acting is superb, and the music is top-notch. I didn't see the high frame rate version, but the 24 fps looked great.
positive	With the success of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, expectations for the Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey were tremendously high, with many wondering whether Jackson's return to Middle Earth would be as good as the first.
positive	I am truly happy when an original story is brought to the big screen, in the case of The Hobbit it is by no means original, but Peter Jackson's treatment of it makes it feel original and new.
positive	Great pictures ... lighting ... visual effects and sound effects ... perfect editing... it is a cinema movies and must be watched just there. Great story ...
positive	Once Again Big Name's show nothing except only effects. This time Perter Jackson also disappoint as other big directors. Story line is not that good enough to Make like this movie and make also parts.
positive	I was most impressed not by Bilbo, Gandalf or the Dwarfs, but by the Brown Wizard, who is one of the Five Great Wizards of Middle Earth.
positive	This movie as any middle-earth movies is perfect,but the one thing that i liked but should not be in the movie is the stone-giants scene but just because other people(not me)will not enjoy it.
negative	Furry midgets walk though a field for three hours whilst exchanging terrible dialogue and wearing ridiculous costumes that look like they were salvaged from a charity shop.
positive	I have watched The Lord Of The Ring trilogy over and over and after now having seen The Hobbit, I gotta admit-I like it!
positive	To be honest, at first I was a little reluctant to spend almost three hours to see thiz movie but I know I will go anyway, just for curiosity's sake. However, it ends up with "Wow!
positive	The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is less than my expectation. The 48 fps cinematography is awesome but not for my (traditional) taste. Its beautiful scenes are just too 'beautiful', losing its realistic magnet.
mutual	Having high expectations after LOTR, this movie really let me down for several reasons. Sections of it dragged very slowly, perhaps to fill time to make it last for three films.
mutual	Back in 2001, when critics and audiences alike were raving about a new film called The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, I was reluctantly dragged to the cinema t
positive	The movie was spectacular, though very different from the book. The differences were,
positive	Yes, it's not quite as good as the Lord of the Rings trilogy and probably a bit too long, but I still thought it was awesome!
positive	OK, I can start by saying that this film definitely is a must see for every (or not) fan of the Tolkien universe, but, this time Jackson is abusing from his success of the LOTR trilogy.
positive	I went into this Film with great expectations, after the LOTR trilogy which I have always loved. I had doubts when it was announced to be released in three parts.
positive	After the unfortunate, but inevitable end to the original breathtaking trilogy in 2003 the reemergence of both Middle-earth and Peter Jackson has unquestionably created a grea
positive	Watching The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey in a movie theatre was undoubtedly the best experience i've ever had watching a movie. I watched it in the regular 2D 24fps, and it was extremely immersive.
positive	The revisit to Middle-Earth itself required a collaboration of three production studios. Let alone the challenges of stretching the smaller material into a trilogy in higher frame rate picture.
positive	I wasn't expecting this film would this good. Somehow, I kept thinking stretching the material into three long films would lessen its magic, but when Peter Jackson directs, we know he will raise the bar.
positive	I made the mistake of reading many reviews prior to watching the movie and as a result my expectations were low. After watching the movie though I am left in awe and am eagerly looking ahead to part 2.
positive	I don't know how this movie will be perceived by the time you read this, but right now, as I'm writing this, it is definitely not given the praise it deserves.
positive	Sir Peter Jackson is really trying to keep the franchise going with this prequel to the Lord of the Rings films.
positive	Peter Jackson's "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey" is an uneven start of the journey of the Hobbit Trilogy that is filled with both good and bad moments that will appeal and appall casual viewers and Tolkienites alike.
positive	Anyone who knows my taste in movies knows that I usually favor the fantasy genre. Heck, I even gave a positive review to this summer's "Snow White and the Huntsman".
positive	Made the hour-and-fifteen-minute-long trip to a city to watch the special high-frame-rate version of THE HOBBIT.
positive	'THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY': Five Stars (Out of Five)
positive	I personally think the one main reason why I'm not satisfied with The Hobbit is because of how Lord of the rings impacted me.
positive	I was very excited to finally see The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey since I was in love with LOTR movies and have seen them over 30 times in the last 10 years.
positive	The 3D work was OK though it screamed that it was not made with that in mind. Most of the impressive 3D shots were gimmicks entered later with CGI. Some scenery, e.g.
negative	If you are not a die hard fan of the books, this movie has absolutely nothing in it, worth spending 3 hours in a cinema. If you're curious, wait till the DVD comes out, and spend it on the couch, where the pause and scroll buttons are readily available.
negative	Caught completely off guard by this movie. Someone should have been more clear about it's "purpose" in the entire trilogy. At least that way viewers (me) could have adjusted their expectations.
positive	It's been eleven years since Peter Jackson brought us groundbreaking Lord of the Rings trilogy, and nine years since The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, the mother of all conclusions.
positive	If you've seen the Lord of the Rings trilogy, you'll find this film very familiar. Like the previous three, this film follows a similar plot: to overcome a series of random obstacles to reach a goal.
positive	While I was entertained overall, I found myself bored at times especially during the actions scenes. The CGI has gone too far and poisoned the film making process.
positive	Loved the movie, being a LOTR fan, you should not be disappointed, actually you cannot be disappointed. The story itself is too good to resist. And with THAT cast and director, no way!
positive	A must watch. If you are a fan of LOR trilogy then you will definitely love it. Everything is awesome, HFR 3d is really amazing,worth to watch that . Peter Jackson is really great.
positive	The Hobbit part 1 was simply a work of art. One does not simply walk into the theaters thinking that The Hobbit will be like the LOTR series.
positive	There are no spoilers in this review. This is simply about the euphoria I experienced in the movie theater. You will relish this you have any clue about Tolkien and Lord of The Rings.
positive	Some may regard the following as spoilers!
positive	The Hobbit
positive	In this review I just wanted to talk about HFR. Maybe it's just me but HFR has an opposite effect on me then what it's supposed to have. I read many reviews from HFR enthusiasts about how HFR makes everything sharper, brighter and smoother.
positive	I have an opportunity to see The Hobbit : An Unexpected Journey in the cinema; especially HFR 3D ^^ I think it is smoother than the general 3D that we see at the moment, and I will confirm that The Hobbit is the best 3D film that I've ever seen before.
positive	I for one am one of those who thought that Peter Jackson should have done The Hobbit first or not at all. After seeing this movie I am still of that opinion.
positive	Had rewarding day with my dad as we went to see The Hobbit together. We were not the only father and son team at the 11am morning show on Boxing day!
positive	Unwittingly misunderstood by critics as a a book directed towards a slightly younger audience. The hobbit captures the stunning light hearted story telling of this phase of Tolkiens world. Bringing its passionate messages to the big screen.
positive	OK, I've just seen it twice in the past two days. The Hobbit was the first English book I completely finished reading, and I love LOTR (both the books and the movies), so my expectation for The Hobbit is pretty high.
positive	The Hobbit is a bit of a chimera. It's a little bit Lord of the Rings, as it should be as it covers events leading up to that story, and its a little bit light-hearted adventure through middle-earth.
positive	Every great story has a beginning. That is what The Hobbit is to The Lord of The Rings. Before I actually start I want to acknowledge that a lot of critics are very hard on this movie.
positive	When the Hobbit first came out, I was disappointed with the mixed reviews, mostly negative coming from movies.com and other sources. I read the books as a child so of course I was going to see it regardless, and I must say the movie met my expectations.
positive	I loved this movie. The sets are amazing. The CGI is unbelievably believable. The acting is very good, with an excellent Gollum performance (as expected).
positive	I am a fan of the previous 3 lord of the rings movies. The hobbit however I have mixed feelings for. The first hour felt like I was watching a B grade fantasy movie. The camera work and the overall feel of the movie didn't site right with me.
positive	This review may contain spoilers, and is my first review. Viewing this as a die-hard Lord of the Rings fan, I knew that Peter Jackson would put his whole heart into the Hobbit, if only for the sake of the viewer.
positive	I watched The Hobbit at a premiere screening here in Malaysia. Although I did not get to watch it in the HFR(48fps) version, but I manage to watch it in IMAX 3D.
positive	After reading some of the reviews posted by professional critics, my expectations about the standards of this movie were somewhat lowered. Nonetheless, I thought of giving it a shot because I am a big fan of the LOTR series.
positive	I was a kid when I watched LOTR trilogy and I mad about this movie, I would have watched the fellowship for at-least 5 times in the first two week on its release and the same followed with the Two Tower and Return of the king.
positive	I have to admit, when I went to the theater I was jittery about what Peter Jackson might do to one of the most cherished parts of my childhood -- and life.
positive	Some of the reviews by professional critics have called The Hobbit overblown and bloated. YES it is long.
positive	Overall I thought the movie was good, but it didn't have that LOTR feel to it, which is what makes LOTR, well LOTR.
positive	This is an amazing film.....the HFR is a joy to behold and the 3D is the best I've seen.......Peter Jackson has once again outdid himself and takes you on an unbelievably amazing journey .
positive	I had my doubts whether Peter Jackson would be a "three-hit wonder", but after watching the Hobbit the day it premiered, I couldn't be more wrong. The story started out slow, gathering momentum.
positive	I could write a long review about this film, but I'm not going to. It seems that many of the long professional reviews are very negative and just a flat out waste of everyone's time.
positive	It's been 9 years since we left Middle Earth, but we never knew that we would ever return to the land of enchantment  the land of dwarfs, elves, wizards and even the littlest of people  hobbits.
negative	First, I should point out that I am not a big LOTR fan. I enjoyed the three LOTR movies and found them to be extremely well done---it's just not my favorite fare. I expected something similar from the Hobbit, entertainment and a well done film. I was greatly disappointed.
positive	Yesterday night, I have met an old friend. I know him, I know everything about him, so there is not much unexpected: the music he likes, places he's visited and his style has not changed a bit.
positive	Before I went to the cinema I heard some negative reviews and opinions on this movie so I expected three hours of boredom but fortunately I was wrong.
positive	I would like to begin with special mention to Howard Shore for his excellent scores which really brings life into the franchise again - At times the heavenly tunes of Elfish a
positive	I am a huge fan of the lord of the rings as well as the hobbit, In my opinion I thought the hobbits first installment was a visual masterpiece.
positive	I went into the cinema with a vague sense of weariness. I have heard many reports that this film is mediocre, too long and badly shot. In all three cases, the warnings were wrong.
negative	I'd consider it highly interesting that after all the reviews I just read the only image in my mind is that of a witness. A witness of rape to be precise.
mutual	I am a fan boy. The LOTR films are my favorite film collections of all time, including The Godfather. That said, while watching The Hobbit today on opening day, I realized how drastically important the score is to these films.
mutual	Catched the late night show of Hobbit, an unexpected journey last night. I knew it wouldn't be as good as the LOTR but this seemed so stretched and overlong, that a few audience members were catching up on their forty winks(well, at least one and it wasn't me.
positive	The complaints about it being too long are ridiculous, and I now see how they can split it into three movies. From what I can remember, I do feel like they stuck pretty close to the story in the book, which I always appreciate.
positive	After seeing the "Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" back in December 2003, I could not help but wonder when Peter Jackson was going to make "The Hobbit.
positive	The Hobbit is more humane and passionate novel aimed at kids. This movie contains those traits, but is certainly not a juvenile film. So ignore what many have said.
positive	I had high expectations, since I am a massive Tolkien fan, and I left the cinema happy. I'm glad that Piter made this movie with "childish" humor, since the book is written in a very different way than the LOTR.
positive	If any of you are at all skeptical of the smallish book being made into three feature length films, cast your doubts aside. Jackson took the classic novel, and expanded upon it.
positive	I hate this movie because it left me wanting more. From beginning, the intense action combined with poetically blended humor put me under an unwavering grip, which didn't left me for days.
positive	The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey 3D 48fps (Frames per Second)
positive	I really don't understand all the hate from critics vs the 48fps! It was 3d without eyestrain! And the movie was definitely not too long for me.
positive	Its 3 hours long, just about, but its brilliant. They seemed to have taken what was good from LOTR and made the Hobbit a lot better. Critics don't seem the like the movie.
positive	Peter Jackson returns to the World of LOTR with grace & near-perfection with 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey'. A Spell-Binding Adventure, that delivers most efficiently. Popcorn Entertainment Personified!
positive	I have seen The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey and it is a great movie! The Hobbit is not as good as The Lord of the Rings movies, but that doesn't mean The Hobbit is a bad movie in any way.
positive	Im a bad reviewer, but short story long Hobbit totally owned Ringsoflord series with this one, i would say it has risen by the double!
positive	Just came from the 3d Imax ( 24 fps) screening and had to write... Firstly, I would like to point I'm a big fan of Jackson's adaptation to LOTR.
negative	Kinda wished the Mayans were right at the moment. Just watched "the Hobbit." Wow. Most disappointing film I've... ever seen.
positive	As a HUGE Lord of the Ring trilogy fan, I was looking forward to going on my own "great adventure" to the movie theater to take in The Hobbit. I was not disappointed as this movie delivered all of the goods and them some!
mutual	Really good directing skills and nice fight scenes; Peter Jackson has a top quality way to put us in the mood!
positive	I went to see The Hobbit with a friend yesterday. He was fairly disappointed, I was amazed. We had a good talk about it afterwards, and I only have one advise for you when it's your turn to take on this journey.
mutual	I don't have time for a full review, now - I'll try to add more later if I can, but I was majorly disappointed. My wife and I just finished re watching the full 12 hours of LotR to get back into Middle Earth, and enjoyed it immensely.
positive	I remember falling in love with the Lord of the Rings trilogy when I was a kid. My little brother and I would spend hours re-enacting the battle within the mines of Moria, the siege of Helm's Deep, and of course, the titanic clash at Minas Tirith.
mutual	Where to start with this?
positive	Peter Jackson's "The Hobbit" has long been in my watch list. Being a huge Tolkien fan and a very big fan of Jackson's previous films, I was ever so eager to watch The Hobbit.
positive	11 hours ago I went to the midnight session of the Hobbit : An Unexpected Journey in 48fps and after a few hours sleep I can tell you that I was totally blown away !
positive	Its finally here people, after 9 years of re-watching the epic "Lord of the Rings" trilogy over and over again Peter Jackson returns us to Middle Earth in "The Hobbit: An unexpected Journey".
positive	Hello Friends! "The Hobbit" is a good movie. Good but nothing great. It's nothing against the real Star Wars-Movies (77 - 83) or the real Indiana Jones-Movies (81 - 89).
positive	To begin with, as many others have stated, the movie is absolutely AWESOME!!! Only super-tiny negative comment I have is that the stone- giant scene felt a bit pushed and unnecessary.
negative	This was one of the most disappointing movies I have ever seen. I have read all of the LOTR books and the Hobbit. The Hobbit was by far my favorite book of all of them because I felt is had so much ADVENTURE in it.
positive	No spoilers! Yes the film is long - 11 minutes shy of 3 hours not including credits, and feels longer than the Fellowship of the Rings.
negative	A rather disappointing journey.
negative	This was a terrible, boring movie with all the awful comic relief, one-liners, and cartoonish, over-the-top retarded action typical of brain-dead Hollywood blockbuster garbage.
positive	I'm not petty, I'm not going to review this movie a high score just to up its average user rating. Some of you gave it a 1/10 even though you thought it was a 5/10, just to bring down the rating. That just makes you look petty and ignorant. So congratulations, you know who you are.
positive	I enjoyed the overall journey it did start off kinda slow though but once they actually got on the road .
positive	It's hard to review a film of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey without considering the source.
positive	You may ask, why is that I like every movie I watch? Is it because someone is paying me to write good reviews? No sir, I am a humble blogger with no strings attached.
positive	It feels like Peter Jackson had a job to do. To make LOTR for a younger audience. As a 3D cinematic experience this movie will amaze you with the image quality and depth.
positive	I admire Peter Jackson, coming from the world of low-budget horror, his desire to take on the epic Lord Of The Rings, and ability to deliver what he did, is hugely impressive.
positive	OK, it's 3 days out and I have already seen it twice. And I will definitely see it a third time before the year is over. So, yeah, I am a fan of Tolkien and Peter Jacksons adaptations of his works.
positive	Typically I only watch a film in 3D only after I've seen it in 2D. Sometimes it feels like 3D comes across as a gimmick and I'd hate to give a film a bad review based on a gimmick that did not work out well.
positive	*I must add that I did not see the film in 3D or HFR, only the normal 2D 24fps*
mutual	As a huge Tolkien fan, I had nerves about Lord of the Rings being brought to the big screen. But Peter Jackson and co pulled it off.
positive	First off I am a huge fan of the The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings series, but I'm not rating this movie high because of that, I'm rating it high because it's simply that good! The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the best movie I've seen since Lord of the Rings: Return of the King.
positive	This film is about the Hobbit named Bilbo gets involved in the fight for survival with the Dwarfs in the Middle Kingdom.
positive	Its inevitable but to draw comparisons with LOTR trilogy and rightly so. The theme, cinematography, music, some scenes are direct descendants from LOTR with some beautiful 3D visuals.
positive	Fortunately, the first installment of the adaptation of JRR Tolkien's The Hobbit works. Peter Jackson, who directed the Lord of the Rings trilogy a decade ago, comes back to try and tell the more whimsical tale of Bilbo Baggins, dwarfs, and a dragon.
positive	The film did not feel as drawn out beyond its natural length as I had feared, and, refreshingly, the story has not been too tinkered with.
positive	Note: I saw this in the intended HFR 3D Format.
positive	I thought this movie was OK, but I only think that's because I watched the Lord of the Rings when I was 5 and can hardly remember anything about it at all. Plus fantasy films aren't my thing. However my mother who happens to be a huge Lord of the Rings fan loved the movie.
positive	The things that struck me about it were one, it's very long, and it's very long because; two, the pacing is pretty slow for the most part.
positive	Since Sir Peter Jackson's last foray into Middle Earth, he's created the fantastic (King Kong) and the fantastically awful (The Lovely Bones), and now we're back and it's like we never left.
negative	Really, really disappointing. Firstly, I love Tolkien, fantasy and Peter Jackson's work. Unfortunately, I found the Hobbit really disappointing.
mutual	My dear Frodo, you asked me once if I had told you everything there was to know about my adventures. Well, I can honestly say I've told you the truth, I may not have told you all of it.
positive	Seriously, bad reviews, go throw yourselves in the Mount of Doom or go knock at the door of the Erebor! I only have one thought : ''This movie was excellent, but you've got to go there with a positive attitude.
positive	That's not a serious film about Tolkien and his "The Hobbit" novel, the novel before the "Lord of the Rings" series. That's a movie for young teenagers. Action is primary and slightly primitive too. And what's more they cut up a one volume book into slices.
positive	I waited forever for The Hobbit and was one of the first few to catch it on December 13 as soon as it opened here.
positive	As a long time fan of Tolkien and reader of The Hobbit, I was somewhat disappointed.. Why all the fillers? You don't need them, the book is exciting enough as it is.
mutual	Peter Jackson's The Hobbit has been a source of talk as many looked forward to going back to the Lord of the rings realm (Middle Earth). Based on J.R.R.
mutual	I found this little-long film to be quite entertaining. It is much weaker than the Lord of the Rings trilogy, given that its source material is also weaker.
positive	>>>I saw The Hobbit in the 24 fps, no 3D involved. I did not read the book.<<<<
mutual	A long time has passed since the Dwarf Kingdom of Erebor has been conquered by a fearsome dragon.
positive	This is more a review of the new format, rather than the movie itself.
positive	So I wrote this once, and it said that I didn't have enough lines. So I'm writing more. However I will try to stay on topic as much as possible. In the beginning, it was very loud.
positive	It's too long, easily a half hour could have been cut out by eliminating filler side-stories. By far the best part of the movie is the "Riddles in the Dark" segment with Gollum.
negative	First of all, let me give you a short anecdote of what happened to me while I was watching this movie in the theater.
positive	for me not many movies deserves an applause. hobbit is one movie which lingers in my heart for so long. as far as i know a cinematic masterpiece has a range which cannot be reached by ordinary blockbuster even if they are good.
positive	I didn't really follow the development news about this film - The Lord of the Rings trilogy largely satisfied my lotr fandom.
positive	Approached out of the blue by Gandalf, Bilbo finds himself joining a company of thirteen dwarfs led by Thorin. Their journey takes them into the Wild; through treacherous lands swarming with Goblins and Orcs, Shapeshifters and Sorcerers.
mutual	I went to see "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey" yesterday.It is one of the most anticipated movies of 2012 and when it finally came out,there was a major difference between the user and critic rating,probably the biggest I have seen on the IMDb.
negative	The hobbit
mutual	A basic comparison of the opening film of the near-perfect Lord of the Rings trilogy and this opening film for The Hobbit films reveals the problem at the root of this unpolished movie: urgency.
positive	I kept up with all of the news and production videos leading up to this movie. I had my doubts about how this movie would turn out. Peter Jackson did change the time-line a little and a few of the events were altered also. But all in all, the movie was very enjoyable for me.
positive	I went into Peter Jackson's latest Lord of the Rings adaptation with mixed expectations (as I imagine everybody else did).
positive	The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey Review
positive	I believe that this film did not live up to the expectations placed on it. However, it was in fact a great film.
positive	Had high expectations but was disappointed. I would say there were moments of engagement with the audience at a very high level. The troll/orc camp-fire scene was superb.
positive	what a movie, speechless. Peter Jackson's achievement in the Hobbit cannot be described with simple words but i will try my best.
negative	Spoiler Alert...
negative	I hadn't had the chance to watch it in the cinemas like all normal people did cause they won't bring it nowhere near Macedonia ..so i watched it online (I'm sorry about that,very sorry).
positive	I LOVE LOVE LOVE Peter Jackson and the LOTR series. Maybe that's why I was pretty much disappointed when I walked out of The Hobbit yesterday night, seeing it in 3D HFR on a huge screen.
mutual	I'm not a huge fan of the three "Lord of the Rings" films so my expectations were pretty low walking into "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey." I'm not saying that I don't acknowledge J.
positive	That's sadly mainly because of my enjoyment to be back in the universe by Tolkien on screen. There was another IMDb-reviewer here who called it "enjoyable but flawed", and that is exactly what it is.
negative	As one who has always been a fan of the hobbit (my first exposure being the 1977 Cartoon), I must say I was mortified by what I saw on that screen.
negative	Although I enjoyed the Lord of the Ring trilogy, I found this film to be very poor in terms of visualizations, costuming, plot, and character development.
positive	You already know what you are going to get when its more or less the same cast and crew as The Lord Of The Rings, you get excellence in cinematography.
positive	"Expectations" is the name of the game for this movie. If you are expecting a 'LOTR reloaded' kind of flick, you will certainly come out whining.
positive	I've just come back from "The Hobbit" and I can assure everyone that this is not a bad film - not by far. However, if you are not aware of the fact that the source material was originally written for kids, you will miss the darker atmosphere of Tolkien's later works.
positive	I'm not going to say much. Just that the film is beautiful. the cg are fantastic. the action sequences are brilliant. the story is clear and leaves no confusion.
positive	I'm a big fan of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the cinematic quality was like a painting in every scene, it was a master piece to say the least and winning the Academy awards once all 3 films were screened was inevitable.
positive	Just saw the Hobbit: an unexpected Journey. Most amazing visually and cinematic experience. Almost real in 48 fps which did take me 10 minutes to get used to but after that blew me away.
negative	Very sad to say that this was a terrible film. High definition (at least in this cinema) was a complete washout, it looked like a bad episode of Dr Who, or one of those "how we made this film" films that they put on DVDs as a "bonus".
mutual	Well this is a deception: Not even 10 minutes in and you have already been bombarded with all the musical themes of Lord of the Ring - unchanged, not re-harmonized and not re-orchestrated either.
mutual	On it's own, this film is a solid 8, by Hollywood blockbuster standards.
negative	The sad thing is that long before they had even begun to work on Peter Jackson's new film 'THE HOBBIT' the presentations of the films representing the three volumes of JRR To
positive	A curious Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, journeys to the Lonely Mountain with a vigorous group of Dwarfs to reclaim a treasure stolen from them by the dragon Smaug.
positive	After watching the premiere of "the hobbit: an unexpected journey", I could finally breathe out in relief, and know that The Hobbit trilogy is off at a good start.
positive	I don't know what critics have seen but what I saw was an excellent movie, That I enjoyed very much. Was it really long ? yes. Was it boring ? NO, not at all!
positive	What a Spectacular movie! I never thought anyone, even Peter Jackson, could beat the class of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Well, The Hobbit is well on its way!
mutual	A strangely cheerless film, with only a few moments of authentic humor, and even fewer authentic moments at all.
positive	I just saw it (in 2d) - it's not better than the Lord of the Rings trilogy (not even a bit); - i agreed that sometimes the movie seems a little bit childish; - i think that 2h
positive	When I heard that Peter Jackson was directing a new hobbit film initially I freaked out with excitement. Then when I found out he had divided it into three parts, I began to have suspicions about the quality of the work. Were my suspicions vindicated? Sorta
positive	A short review. Yes, I am a lord of the rings fan but only because I enjoyed the books so thoroughly. The hobbit was the first English book I read and I have very fond memories of it. I loved the well described characters, the tale of the journey and all the adventures that Tolkien describes.
mutual	Disappointed! I agree I didn't expect something as great as LOTR, but still the movie lacks many things. It doesn't have enough story and depth to sustain your interest, and to be a movie separately.
mutual	I read The Hobbit many years ago (well before the Lord if the Rings, the Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales, etc) but I had a somewhat different picture in my mind as to what a movie adaptation would be like.
mutual	I've seen this movie yesterday. It was boring. The fight scenes were somehow nice, but that was expected. It was the first time in long period when I saw people leaving before the end.
negative	This is one of three movies I have ever walked out on. I would have rather have watched paint dry. First of all, the high frame rate makes it look like video. The acting was atrocious.
negative	One of the lamest movies I have ever seen, really predictable, another thing that honestly make me laugh, was that every time something happened through the movie and something intense was about to happen everyone was magically saved (LITERALLY) pathetic.
negative	Typically, I love Peter Jackson. The first set of movies are amazing and pretty accurate to JRR Tolkien's books. For The Hobbit, the made up a new story.
mutual	I've been a fan of the Tolkien books since my father read us The Hobbit when I was 5.
positive	There are films that define a decade. Works of the seventh art that one must view in the future to better understand culture, taste and trends of a particular time period.
mutual	I just watched the movie in the cinema and as i had feared i was terribly disappointed. I think "The Hobbit" is one more movie added to the long string of "big budget spectacular movies" that could have been so much more.
mutual	I had high hopes for The Hobbit, after Peter Jackson, Warner Bros, and the NZ government sold off our labour laws for this $540,000,000 monster. Alas I was met with disappointment.
positive	OK so this movie is one I have been waiting for since forever. so I was glad to go to the first screening of it in my local town yesterday.
positive	Sadly, this movie doesn't threaten to topple the greatness of LOTR. It is a good movie, for sure, but like for so many artists looking to follow up on a monumental achievement, it doesn't reach the same heights.
positive	Q: What do you, as Hollywood, do to a movie series that has garnered tremendous commercial success and massive critical acclaim? A: You revisit it. Of course.
positive	The Lord of the Rings made me fall in love with movies. A towering achievement of craftsmanship and epic yet intimate storytelling, Peter Jackson's film trilogy was a visionary piece of filmmaking that had me dreaming for over a decade.
negative	This movie could have been cut by an hour. It's just way too dragged out. Every scene is three times as long as it should be and this results in breaking up the narrative and losing any dramatic build up.
negative	I went to this movie with my boyfriend.. OMG..!! Such a boring movie it was.. And the character Hobbit(Hero) is the waste-fellow here... He made the movie dirty and too boring.
negative	This is not "The Hobbit" it is a fantasy story that uses similar names and scenario to portray a pop culture, cheesy actioned ADHD and altogether shallow portrayal of something similar to what Tolkien wrote.
negative	Wow, just got back from seeing it and I can't believe how boring it was!
positive	First of all, let me say I'm a great fan of all of Tolkiens works. Silmarillion is being read like the bible in my house, and yet I can't feel satisfied with this first part of The Hobbit.
positive	I have high respect for Peter Jackson for managing to direct three great films based on the Lord of The Rings (abbreviated as LOTR from here on) by J.R.R.
negative	I must preface this by saying that I think the film is more like a 6, but I am giving it a 1 because I think that its current 8.6 rating is exaggerated.
positive	I've been looking forward to seeing this film since I first heard it was being made. I loved the Lord of the Rings trilogy and have read The Hobbit hundreds of times.
positive	7 Stars = Very Good
positive	... I saw the movie on Friday in Mülheim CinemaxX. In 3D and HFR nearly 15 Euros were due. To put it straight to the point, the image was technically, for long stretches, a major disappointment for me.
positive	One of the Remarkable director in this era 'Peter Jackson' returns with the prequel "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey" is a new trilogy from the Lord of the Ring series based on 1937 J.
positive	I was waiting for the movie to be released and watched it yesterday evening.The hobbit is good to watch and it is not better than the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy.
positive	While Peter Jackson is a fine director, he is emphatically not Tolkien or the authority on Middle Earth.
positive	Henny's Movie Review: The Hobbit unexpected journey": (Spoilers Free)
positive	In the Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, Peter Jackson brings us back to Tolkien's Middle Earth in a very good almost flawless way.
positive	As a children's film about a fantasy adventure this is alright. Don't go in expecting this to be as spectacular as the Lord of the Rings trilogy or you will definitely be disappointed.
positive	First of all, before I say anything, I respect Peter Jackson A LOT. The LOTR trilogy was amazing and King Kong was terrific!
positive	This is my first review What can I say except for bravissimo! It was a great movie, it has it's ups and downs.
positive	J.R.R. Tolkien's classic, The Hobbit, is finally getting the big screen treatment with the first part of a planned trilogy to bring the tome to life, An Unexpected Journey, now in theaters.
positive	First, I think people who are "true" fans, the D&D, Gamers are going to love this film no matter what. I love the other three, but to give you my honest opinion, this film is so slow of a start that I wanted to give up on it.
positive	The movie was good, the story great, and the cinematography excellent - I suppose this was a great film; however, I didn't leave feeling it was a great film!
positive	The wait is over, the long awaited prequel to Lord Of The Rings is finally here,.
positive	Wow, all I can say is wow. An Unexpected Journey is a lovely start to what will most definitely be an amazing trilogy. It looked amazing and the 3D has been done very well making you feel as if you were there from time to time.
positive	I found The Lord of the Rings cinematographic trilogy an extraordinary adaptation of essential novels from fantastic genre.
negative	As a follower of Tolkien, I went to watch the Hobbit with anticipation. There were a few really good parts, but most of it I was very disappointed with.
positive	Boy oh boy, it's been already eleven years since Peter Jackson gave new cinematic life to the work of J.R.R. Tolkien.
negative	Hello, director: Have you heard that beside males, there is another gender i.e. females. Except one actress (5-10 minutes present in the film), ALL other characters are male characters.
positive	Saw this for the big bucks, 3D and IMAX and the cinematography was mesmerizing. I loved the beginning and end but the middle seemed to drag on and on.
positive	While i still think this might not surpass the LOTR franchise, i do believe Peter Jackson once again drive home an epic male journey in his unique style.
positive	I am not a big fan of The Lord of the Rings films simply because they are just way too long... I'm sure the films are great, but I tried watching the second one and I ended up falling asleep.
positive	To Start off, I'm a fantasy freak and a huge fan of Peter Jackson's movies. I went to this movie mainly to see what different did he do from TLOTR and i must admit the movie was amazing.
mutual	The Lord of the Rings movies were so fantastic that I was willing to overlook a few invented scenes. The Hobbit strays much further from Tolkien's text; greatly overdramatizes many action scenes just because CGI enables it; and has too many corny-joke moments in what should be a sober tale.
positive	So the day came that I have waited for in over a year, yes since the hobbit trailer came out. First things I must criticizes a bit is why did they add Frodo in the plot?
positive	I remember seeing the first three Lord of The Rings films in the theatre and honestly finding them sort of boring and uninteresting. Maybe they just weren't my genre or I wasn't in the mood.
positive	I grew up on the Hobbit cartoon and the incomplete LOTR Ralph Bahkski cartoons and all the books Hobbit, LOTR, and Silmarillion being my favorite group of stories ever.
mutual	This movie is boring and it has a lot of liberality in regards to following the book. For instance the way to Rivendale is different. The manner in which the Dwarfs arrive is different as is their behavior.
negative	I read the Hobbit many times as a boy and I honestly wanted this to be a good film. There were a lot of special effects that were pretty good.
mutual	It begins with a prologue (featuring Ian Holm and Elijah Wood, both looking rather waxy) that accomplishes very little other than delaying the start of the real story.
mutual	I remember Peter Jackson said in one of the Lord of The Rings DVDs that he won't direct another movie related to Lord of The Rings, looks like he ate his words!
positive	I saw it in 3d 48fps and it was truly amazing!the visuals were stunning.I expected a better script and something extraordinary from Jackson and the 270 million budget that he had to work with.
negative	When I was at Wallmart's at the nerd films section, I was thrilled to see a J R Tolkien title with the movie "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey", and looking at the credits, I was also encouraged to buy it.
negative	I went to the movie with my friends to have good time, and this movie ruined it. First to say, the high frame rate isn't impressive.
positive	A massive fan of the Lord Of The Rings films so was so looking forward to the Hobbit.
negative	I am fairly disappointed in rating this movie as I'm a huge fan of Jackson and am a true admirer of his message-through-film approach. But, unfortunately he's made this movie just for getting huge box-office collections which as he mentioned some time back as "against his principles".
mutual	3D-48fps, before i get into the review i have to say i am a LOTR fan and rate the trilogy in my personal top 10, as such i was really looking forward to this release.
mutual	All is grand and neat with 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey'. From frame one till the last, there is enough thrill, spill and chill that one would normally associate with Jackson. Perhaps it is double here. The magic of WETA and the aura of PETA have been combined well to weave a magic on screen.
negative	This piece of art belongs to trash as (almost) every mainstream movie produced in Hollywood these days. Characters turned into soulless dolls in hands of screen writers high on pounds of cocaine.
negative	It's hard to know where to begin when reviewing this 3 hour Peter Jackson disaster. You could start with the High Frame Rate production, which gives everything an unreal/hyper-real quality which is distracting to the point of farce.
negative	Yes, this film is so repetitive, it even repeats the same plot holes from LOTR.
mutual	Ever hear the old expression, "Making a Mountain out of a Mole Hill"? Well that's exactly what we have here.
negative	Its always sad when money beats art, but its just not understandable when people like Jackson (like Lucas before him), who already have made more than enough money, are still greedy enough to choose money over art.
negative	This is what happens when you take a short pleasant novel and try to stretch it out into 3 excruciatingly long films.
negative	Oh no, it's happened again! Not one week goes by after I mentioned this very film in a review of Ron Howard's "Willow" and the BBC offer a straight up comparison between the two by previewing "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey" today.
mutual	Here is what really bothers me about this movie: As the movie opens, a birthday party is about to begin. Bilbo Baggins is turning 111 years old (and Frodo is turning 33)...
negative	It's a really good as far as visual effects...but wow it is a lot darker than it needed to be. They changed a whole lot of the original story...and it's just way too violent and dark for my tastes.
mutual	who would have thought that Morgan Freeman would be so convincing in whiteface?
positive	Yes, the headline was 75% sarcastic. But with that being said, "The Hobbit" really is one of the best animated movies of all time, along with Avatar.
negative	I am a big fan of LOTR. However while watching The Hobbit; a question kept striking me "why o' why?" This was what we STAR WARS fans felt after watching the second installments of series.
negative	48fps.
negative	Poorly structured and devoid of tension - This was a huge disappointment. I enjoyed about 20 mins of inventive set pieces near the end but I was surprised I was still awake by the time I got there.
mutual	As a huge fan of the LOTR trilogy, I have to say first that I loved the High Frame Rate 3D format which created Middle Earth On Steroids and made me not mind so much how repetitive most of the film was of LOTR elements because we got to see them more up close and personal.
positive	Peter Jackson again took some liberties with the narrative that may irk the purists around us.
negative	It's not like I really wanted to see it, I just was seeing how comparable it was to the The Lord Of The Rings.
negative	Long, boring, tedious...made me long for the book. The set up takes forever and the battle scenes are endless and in the end you just don't care anymore.
negative	There are a lot of things that are just wrong with this movie overall and there just as much things going wrong with the original story as well.
positive	I grew up reading the books and was pleased with Peter Jackson screen adaptation of the trilogy. Reading some of the reviews I can see I will be in the minority here but I had some problems with this latest film.
positive	The trailer was interesting but since I had $18 dollars invested I stayed for the Hobbit. I hadn't seen the other Lord of the Rings movies and had heard they were good so I was excited to finally see what I had missed.
negative	Today I am going to tell you about one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The movie that I am going to tell you about is 'the Hobbit', directed by Peter Jackson.
negative	I found this film very depressing. I went to watch it today with my school, and to be honest I could not wait for it to say "The End".
positive	The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was the most anticipated movie of the year in our family. I for one admire many of the actors in the cast, and I love the Lord of the Rings films and Tolkein's writing.
negative	I loved The Hobbit books, and hated the Lord of the Rings books and movies. I thought I would like The Hobbit movie. I saw this in 3d and 48fps. I wasn't impressed at all.
negative	Two things are remarkable about this film. First, and not terribly damaging, are the hairstyles. Vidal Sassoon on acid. It will probably take a PH.D.
negative	I went to see this movie after reading the rave reviews on IMDb.com. But now I am left disillusioned. Perhaps this film is a heaven for fan-boys, but not so for us regular movie folk.
negative	It's a Friday night and i am twiddling my fingers what i should do for the evening, my friends call me up and say you want to make a journey to the cinema, it was unexpected as they normally want to go the local bar for a drink or two. They said let's go and watch The Hobbit, why not
negative	I watched the movie last night and it was absolutely boring and flat. There is a lot of unnecessary dialogs. Most of the scenes could have been made much shorter. The fighting scenes are not cool either.
mutual	Lord of the Rings part 1 The Directors Remix, would be a more apt title. If you value the wrapping over the present, then this film will satisfy you, or if you like repeats.
negative	You would have more fun reading the book.
negative	First the good news- It is better than the Lovely Bones
negative	"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey" is a failure of epic proportions. If you see it in HFR 3D, that is.
negative	U can see that in Chennai theatres, when u hear this dialogue all people will berserk .whoa!! what a film ,i was amazed really to see such a film.
positive	The mountain kingdom of Erebor contains an immense amount of natural riches, gold and gems, and it attracts attention of other peoples, as well as that of the fire-breathing dragon, Smaug.
negative	literally the first freaking hour of the movie they are still in the "hobbit hole" Bilbo's house and slightly still introducing characters!
positive	Once upon a time, the Kingdom of Erebor in the Lonely Mountain was taken from the dwarfs by the evil dragon Smaug.
mutual	Dear Peter Jackson, after giving us perfect films in the Rings trilogy, you now have to go and spoil things. the warnings started with King Kong a very good film but a half hour too long.
negative	Every age produces its own sort of fables, and our age seems to have produced The White Messiah fable.
positive	This is my first review so pls don't make fun of it. Now time to get on with it, i would like to say that all of the people saying that this
positive	THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY (2012) ***1/2 Martin Freeman, Ian McKellen, Richard Armitage, Ken Stott, Graham McTavish, William Kircher, James Nesbitt, Stephen Hunter, Dea
positive	Nothing short of the best damned movie in the whole world, makes "shawshank redemption" look like "get smart" , saw it in New Zealand myself, some of the crowd actually killed themselves it was so impressive.
mutual	It had been nine years The Lord of the Rings Trilogy based on the famous J.R.R.
negative	I Have red the hobbit , I've red Lord Of The Rings, thus i was exited to see them coming alive on the big screen. Lord of the Rings was superb, no question about it. Now "The Hobbit" came along and failed on an epic scale.
mutual	After a long long time, I was overjoyed after watching some movie. Wonderfully written script and at the top of that marvelous execution on the screen. A commendable screen play it was in the movie.
mutual	I think this movie released somewhere around Thursday in Wellington, as I walked past one of major movie halls, I saw Ian McKellen moustached new look staring down at me from
negative	"Hobbit" is a joke... Who can't see the mistakes in the movie is a child or an huge ignorant... Hobbits have mail in The Shire? Bilbo needs to sign a contract to join the dwarfs in their journey?
negative	Its based on the Hobbing but the film is good Peter Jackson finally proved he can make all movie for any child , romantic , and really politically correct so once again two cheers to the director Peter Jackson.
negative	Peter Jackson makes sure that 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' appeals to children. It's got all the required elements: fantasy, fairy, fairy-tale story, kids etc.
