Test #1: Piano Sonatas


Late Romantic: Rachmononoff Preludes or etudes 
	(2 sets of preludes and 2 sets of etudes)
	You can recognize them
	(some more slow, lyrical)


Classical: Mozart (any of his piano sonatas)
	- Major key ones more in his style


Baroque: Bach: Goldberg Variations or Well-Tempered Clavier
	- Goldbverg Variations more consistent in style


Early Romantic: Chopin Noctures (more similar in consistency than his preludes somewhat)




Harder: Mozart vs Haydn (any of the piano sonatas)
